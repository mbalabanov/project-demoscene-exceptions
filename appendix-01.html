                This first appendix examines the technical options to preserve
                demos on the Atari ST and other retro computers, many of which
                have been pioneered by the retro-gaming community.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main investigation areas presented herein are the methods
                for capturing and preserving files from obsolete media, finding
                the right screens to display demo art authentically, running
                demos on original hardware and enhanced original hardware, and
                finally, the options that emulation and FPGAs offer for the
                future conservation of demo art.

              <h3 class="mt-5">A1.1. Running the Demos on Original Hardware</h3>
              <p>
                Once the demo files have been salvaged, the demos can be run on
                the original computers they were created on. While here are
                other options, too, the original hardware provides the most
                authentic experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Emulators on modern hardware are very advanced and precise, but
                demos tax the hardware and use tricks that, in some cases, can
                cause graphics glitches and timing issues.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the case of The Exceptions' demos, that would mean setting up
                an original Atari ST, built and sold in 1986 or 1987. Later
                revisions of the Atari hardware can cause incompatibilities
                (particularly the enhanced STE models released in 1989).
              </p>
              <p>
                This thirty-year-old hardware is still available in a functional
                state on the secondhand market. When well maintained, the STs
                still work as originally designed. Only the capacitors on the
                ST's motherboard can be an issue, as they were never engineered
                for decades of use. They can leak acid onto the board and cause
                corrosion of the circuits, but they are easily replaced with
                modern capacitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Demos on the Atari ST were stored on floppy disks, which are
                notoriously error-prone due to demagnetization and corrosion.
                Disks from the late 1980s and early 1990s are mostly unusable
                thirty years later; therefore, that data needs to be salvaged.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, the actual executable files of most demos on the
                Atari ST were salvaged in the early 2000s by demoscene members.
                They are stored as disk images, exact representations of the
                physical disks, stored as an individual downloadable file on
                many of the established demo archives at pouet.net and
                demozoo.org.
              </p>
              <p>
                Floppy images can be run on modern hardware in an Atari ST
                emulator, e.g., Hatari (<a
                  href="http://hatari.tuxfamily.org"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                  >http://hatari.tuxfamily.org</a
                >
                on Windows, macOS, and Linux) or Steem SSE (<a
                  href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/steemsse/"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                  >https://sourceforge.net/projects/steemsse/</a
                >
                on Windows). Disk images can also be used on original Atari ST
                hardware from a hard disk or other mass storage devices.
              </p>
              <p>
                Should a demo not yet be available as a disk image in one of the
                demo archives, then a disk image can be created either on an
                Atari ST or on a modern-day PC with a suitable 3.5" floppy
                drive.

                A1.2 The Perniciousness of Salvaging Fickle Files from Obsolete
                Media
              </h3>
              <p>
                Existing demo archives have extracted demo files from the
                original diskettes and stored them as floppy images. These are
                exact captures of full floppy disks stored as individual files
                on the SD card. The demoscene community has done an admirable
                job of conserving as many demos as possible, but there are
                certainly more demos still to be found that need to be
                conserved.
              </p>
              <p>
                How are floppy images created? Today's computers cannot read
                most floppy disks from obsolete systems like the Atari ST and
                the Commodore Amiga. Some historic drives varied the rotation
                speed to ensure a constant write rate, while other systems
                worked with different numbers of sectors. In addition, many
                diskettes were copy protected or used unusual disk formats,
                deviating even from their own standards.
              </p>
              <p>
                Floppy disks are divided into tracks and sectors. The format of
                old MS-DOS diskettes used 40 tracks; more modern ones use 80
                tracks. Each track has between nine and 36 sectors; floppy disks
                with nine tracks are called double density (DD) disks, and disks
                with 18 sectors are called high density (HD). All disks have one
                thing in common: the important first sectors. The very first is
                the boot sector, followed by sector 0. To this day, the method
                used for older storage devices is the file allocation table
                (FAT). This FAT follows in sectors 1-9 and 10-18, the main
                directory area, and then, finally, the actual data area.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if a sector only contains 512 bytes of user data, it takes
                up more space on the floppy disk to include the index, sync, or
                CRC bits. The controller uses the sync bits to recognize the
                beginning of a sector, or the beginning of a track via an index
                hole in the diskette.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before IBM compatibles, MS-DOS, and then Windows became the
                industry standard; most home computers used the same physical
                floppy disks, but each had their own standard. The Apple
                Macintosh, for example, also used DD disks but with eleven
                sectors per track. The additional storage space was created by
                formatting slightly shorter gaps between the user data, so a
                total of 800 Kbytes could fit on a DD disk instead of 720
                Kbytes.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Atari ST ostensibly used standard MS-DOS-compatible disk
                drives that could be easily read by PCs, but even then, there
                were slight deviations. Being what it is, the demoscene was
                never content to simply adhere to the manufacturer's standards
                and limitations, so they started creating their own formats to
                extend the disk's data or for copy protection.
              </p>
              <p>
                A variety of tricks were used for copy protection. One method,
                for example, was to incorporate deliberate errors, like
                illegible sectors, or to change the disk controller's clock
                frequency. Another method was to use different sector sizes,
                oversized formatting, or a shifted index; the individual
                application or game was written to look for these deviating
                mechanisms, while the software used to copy it did not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Regular floppy drives are not particularly smart devices. They
                simply read the requested data, including all the control bits.
                However, the control bits never pass the controller, meaning
                that normal PC disk drives with their standard controllers
                cannot fully read disks of a non-standard format.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are two methods to salvage old disks: The first is to use
                an original Atari ST with the right software, and the second is
                to use a dedicated device attached to a modern PC.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ST application <em>Pasti</em> (<a
                  href="http://pasti.fxatari.com"
                  target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                  >http://pasti.fxatari.com</a
                >) produces a disk image file from an original disk, including
                any unusual format and copy-protection. On their website, Pasti
                states:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Our main goal is the preservation of Atari software in its
                original unmodified form. Original software is normally stored
                on diskettes with custom format or copy protection. Standard
                tools cannot back up or image them. But floppy disk recordings
                have a limited lifetime. It won't take too long until all
                original Atari disks will be damaged and lost."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In practice, the original diskette is inserted into the Atari
                ST's drive, and Pasti reads it track by track, sector by sector,
                and creates a disk image. The file can be saved onto a hard disk
                and then transferred to a modern-day PC using a nullmodem-cable
                or saved on a Gotek or HxC floppy emulator (see below).
              </p>
              <p>
                The second option is the use of <em>Kryoflux</em> on a modern
                computer (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-88">figure 88</a>). This is a
                peripheral device connected between a floppy disk drive and the
                PC's USB port (Linux, macOS, or Windows). On their website at
                <a href="https://www.kryoflux.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                  >https://www.kryoflux.com</a
                >, the manufacturer describes their product as:
              </p>

              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "KryoFlux is a USB-based device designed specifically for the
                reliability and precision needed to acquire reliable low-level
                reads suitable for software preservation."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The Kryoflux software can handle image formats for a wide
                variety of obsolete computers, including the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                The disk is inserted into the modern disk drive connected to the
                Kryoflux and the modern computer. It reads the legacy disk, and
                its contents end up as a disk image for further use.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most common disk image formats end in .ST and .STX. There is
                also the .MSA format, which is rare. Files ending in .ST are
                sector-specific images of the respective original diskette,
                while files ending in .STX are mainly used for some
                copy-protected games and more exotic original disk formats.

              <h4>A1.2.1 How to Extend the Life of Spinning Disks</h4>
              <p>
                Three-and-a-half-inch floppy drives can have mechanical
                failures, especially as time progresses. Disk drives have
                rubberized plastic belts that make the disk spin, and these
                belts can stretch to become unusable or even tear as a result of
                being 30 years old. Decades of age also take their toll on the
                material, making it brittle or turning it into soft sludge. The
                belts can be replaced, which might alleviate the issue at hand,
                but any disk drive is bound to fail eventually and needs to be
                replaced over time.
              </p>
              <p>
                The drives themselves are fully compatible with double density
                (DD) 3.5" floppy drives produced for IBM PC compatibles in the
                1980s. These replacement drives are generally available in used
                condition and, due to their wide adoption, are still maintained
                and repaired by specialty shops. They can read 720KB floppy
                disks. Please note that the high-density (HD) floppy drives that
                store 1.44 MB of data by default are not compatible with the
                early models of the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                Even if the floppy disk drive is fully functional, it has the
                drawback of long loading times that, while authentic, can
                negatively impact the experience.
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternatively, floppy drives can be forgone altogether, and a
                hard disk can be attached. Original hard drives are hard to find
                in working condition, but the Atari ST has a variant of the SCSI
                interface. Using a SCSI-to-IDE converter, you can attach a more
                modern IDE hard disk that is more widely available to this day.
                The disk images can be transferred from a modern-day PC to the
                Atari ST using a Null-Modem serial to USB connector, saved on
                the hard disk, and then executed on the original hardware using
                Pasti (<a href="http://pasti.fxatari.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                  >http://pasti.fxatari.com</a

                A1.3 Cathode Ray Tubes in the Age of Liquid Crystals
              </h3>
              <p>
                The next concern of running demos close to the original is the
                monitor display. Like it's contemporaries, the Atari ST used a
                tube display, a now-obsolete technology. The most authentic way
                to visually experience original demos is on a cathode ray tube
                (CRT) display. This is a large topic to consider: finding the
                right balance between an authentic visual experience, on the one
                hand, and a feasible and sustainable visual experience on the
                other hand. This topic requires a more in-depth discussion.
              </p>
              <p>
                CRT screens flicker, display frayed colors, and have very low
                resolution, making the image objectively awful. Nevertheless,
                the output of a retro computer, like the Atari ST and older
                machines like the Commodore 64 and Apple II, were never intended
                for LCD screen clarity. However, there are space concerns when
                using a CRT display. After years of depreciating prices on the
                secondhand market, they have started to rise again as CRTs in
                full working condition are becoming increasingly rare.
              </p>
              <p>
                CRTs already differ externally from flat screens in that they
                are large boxes housing a glass tube. Images on these monitors
                look completely different than on flatscreens because CRTs
                generate images in a fundamentally differently way. While LCDs
                can digitally control each pixel individually, CRTs work
                according to a principle that Ferdinand Braun once developed. An
                electron gun generates a beam that scans across the neon on the
                inside of the tube, line by line from top to bottom. A color
                television has three electron beams that each hit a
                corresponding fluorescent red, green, or blue layer and thus
                build up the picture in RGB colors—at least 50 times a second
                (50Hz).
              </p>
              <p>
                Why use them at all? Do they have any advantages compared to LCD
                screens?
              </p>

              <h4>A1.3.1 Defending the Use of CRTs in the 21st Century</h4>
              <p>
                Each image's pixel flickers into existence for a fraction of a
                second, lighting up only to extinguish again for another
                fraction of a second until it is reignited again as the beam
                takes another pass. This is the reason for the characteristic
                look of images on a CRT: the layers inside the tube generate an
                afterglow, and the generated image lingers slightly longer than
                the passing beam. A shadow mask directly in front of the tube's
                luminous coating ensures that the three electron beams only ever
                illuminate one RGB trio. This does not correspond exactly to the
                pixel, as it does on an LCD screen; some electrons always hit
                neighboring pixels. This creates what is called "color bleed,"
                causing a slight blur of the pixels and creating a more organic
                look compared to the stark clarity of LCDs. This analog
                technology also generates image noise and slight image
                distortions due to the curved pane of glass.
              </p>
              <p>
                Old computers like the Atari ST have a peculiarity in their
                standard output modes. They omit every other scanline, leaving
                it black. This impacts the screen image's look even further by
                introducing called "scanlines" (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-89">figure 89</a>).
                Technically, this term applies to all the lines in the image,
                both those that are empty and the ones holding the image
                information.
              </p>
              <p>
                The number of lines is halved because most old computers and
                consoles display images either in 50 full images with a vertical
                resolution of 288 (PAL standard) or 60 full images with a
                vertical resolution of 240 (NTSC standard). These resolutions
                are called 288p and 240p ("p" for "Progressive Scan").

                Old TV broadcasts of the day produced "interlaced" images. The
                TV signal would not skip every second line as computers would
                but would produce alternating half images with the
                phosphorescent afterglow of the CRT, melding them together in
                the eye of the beholder (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-90">figure 90</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                Up until the late 80s, computers were not yet capable of
                outputting complete images in full resolution. As a compromise,
                every second line was simply left black. This has an impact on
                the aesthetic of computer images produced for and displayed on
                CRTs.

              <h4>A1.3.2 The Alluring Beauty of Visible Scanlines</h4>
              <p>
                Pixel artists in the 80s and 90s counted on these characteristic
                scanlines and employed them to make their figures appear more
                organic. The black scanlines on every other line round off the
                pixels to a certain extent, and there is beauty in the
                scanlines.
              </p>
              <p>
                CRTs and LCDs not only differ at the level of the pixel, but
                they also have different aspect ratios. Most CRT screens were
                built with a 4:3 aspect ratio, while modern LCDs have an aspect
                ratio of 16:9. Since the modern aspect ratio is much wider,
                displaying legacy content on modern displays leaves black bars
                on the left and right. This is called "pillarboxing." In
                addition, modern screens must extrapolate the low resolutions of
                bygone days to their much higher resolution. Most modern screens
                do not simply multiply the pixels but try to calculate the image
                smoothly, which not only changes the original aesthetic but also
                deforms the shape of individual pixels.
              </p>
              <p>
                With very few exceptions, most CRTs can only process analog
                signals. This is inferior to purely digital signals in all ways
                except one: Input lag is minimal when the signal is analog.
                Flatscreens need to process the digital signal to turn it into
                an image, which causes an ever so slight delay caused by the
                algorithms. During most tasks, this delay of a few milliseconds
                is not noticeable, but in games that depend on reaction speed,
                this can be irritating.

                A1.3.3 The Increasingly Unbearable Difficulty of Seeking Out a
                CRT Today
              </h4>
              <p>
                Requisitioning a CRT monitor today is not as simple as it would
                seem, as they haven't been manufactured for years. In contrast
                to the hi-fi or camera scene, where some of the previously
                discontinued old production lines have been reintroduced to
                produce new editions of classic devices, this has not been the
                case for new CRT monitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                When consumers started replacing their old TVs with new LCDs
                flatscreen TVs in the early 2000s, most of the CRTs probably
                ended up in landfills. The search for fully operational,
                high-quality CRTs is becoming increasingly difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, the tube in a CRT ages with every hour of
                operation. The picture turns muddier over time, and the colors
                become increasingly inaccurate.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the retro scene, there is a trend of using CRT TV monitors
                that were originally used in professional television production
                in the 90s and early 2000s. They provide excellent images and
                high build quality. Professional grade displays by Sony, JVC,
                Panasonic, and Ikegama are very well-suited for retro computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Another advantage of the broadcast TV monitors is that they can
                handle PAL and NTSC signals and have an RGB connector.
                Unfortunately, broadcast monitors usually do not have a SCART
                input but only accept RGB signals via BNC connections. SCART is
                the standardized European connector for a clean video signal.
                The BNC (Bayonet Neill-Concelman) connector used to be a
                professional coaxial video connector cable. Interested users
                will require appropriate adapter cables. Additionally, the
                monitors usually have no sound output of their own or only a
                very poor mono speaker if they have sound at all. The audio
                signal must be passed through separately to amplifiers or active
                speakers. An advantage is that they were designed to run
                continuously for tens of thousands of hours. Some of them even
                track the total operating hours.

              </h4>
              <p>
                For high-quality CRT output, you need not solely resort to
                production monitors. One of the most flexible and versatile
                consumer-grade home computer CRTs is probably the Commodore
                1084. Top-end models from the consumer sector, such as Loewe
                televisions or the Bang & Olufsen MX 7000, are also well-suited.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Intergraph 28HD96 is the holy grail of CRT monitors. It is a
                28-inch CRT in a 16:9 aspect ratio with a resolution of up to
                1920 × 1080 pixels, even though it was introduced in the early
                1990s. It is extremely rare on the secondhand market and
                commands high prices. It is a beautiful piece of hardware that
                was ahead of its time in every respect. To be fair, its
                specifications will not be used sufficiently on an Atari ST, and
                it is better suited for PC compatibles in retro-computing.

                A1.3.5 How to Upscale the Signal from the Atari ST for Modern
                Monitors
              </h4>
              <p>
                CRTs still provide the most authentic experience for retro
                software but might not be feasible in every situation. The Atari
                ST would need to be connected to a modern LCD display, but this
                is not a straightforward process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The ST uses an RGB signal for a monitor with 50 and 60Hz
                horizontal frequency and 16KHz vertical frequency. Some ST
                models had an integrated TV modulator that allowed them to be
                attached to TVs of the era and, unfortunately, only from that
                era.
              </p>
              <p>
                The color modes' vertical frequency is the main concern when
                attempting to use it with more modern LCD screens and even later
                models of CRT VGA monitors. Very few multi-sync VGA models could
                handle the 16KHz vertical frequency an ST produced for color
                graphics. The most common VGA monitors expected a 30Hz vertical
                sync. They can be physically attached to an Atari ST using an
                RGB-to-VGA cable, but they will only display the ST's monochrome
                high-resolution of 640 x 400 pixels. Nearly all demos ran in the
                low-resolution color mode of 320 x 200 pixels.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet the situation is not completely hopeless, because a device
                called a video scaler can be used. This is what Wikipedia has to
                say about video upscalers:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "a video scaler or upscaler is a system which converts video

                Essentially, the Atari ST is attached to the upscaler using an
                RGB-to-SCART cable and then attached the upscaler to an LCD
                screen with an HDMI cable.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are many cheap video scalers that provide results of
                varying quality, but there is one particularly reliable true
                HDMI upscaler worth using: the
                <em>Micomsoft Framemeister</em> from Japan (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-91">figure 91</a>). This device
                is popular in the retro gaming scene. It is used by gamers, for
                example, for the Nintendo Super Nintendo video game systems and
                the Sega MegaDrive. The Framemeister takes the original
                low-fidelity signal from the old hardware, runs it through a
                signal processor, and upconverts it to an HD signal to output it
                to the standard HDMI port that can be used with most modern-day
                LCD or OLED HD TVs and monitors. And it does so with a minimal
                processing lag. If a CRT monitor is not available, this setup is
                ideal for demos.

                In conclusion, obtaining the original hardware with all of its
                essential components functioning is not impossible but can be
                challenging. It provides the most authentic experience but has
                many drawbacks.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is a compromise: modifying the original hardware with
                modern components.

              <p>
                There is a scene in the 2017 movie <em>Captain Marvel,</em> set
                in the early 1990s, where our hero, Carol Danvers, finds a
                CD-ROM with information vital to the film's plot. Together with
                her fellow protagonist, Nick Fury, they insert the CD into a PC
                and start retrieving the data.
              </p>
              <p>
                Then, the scene grinds to a halt. Played for laughs, this scene
                deliberately illustrates the excruciatingly slow loading times
                of past storage media. We all might not have seen it that way
                back in the day, but in hindsight and relative to today, things
                seemed to take forever in the past.
              </p>
              <p>
                Technology has evolved greatly since then, and the expectations
                of a casual audience have evolved. This means that we do not
                need to strictly adhere to running demos on the unmodified
                original hardware. The delays and complications of doing so
                detract from the main objective: exposing viewers to demo art.
                Fortunately, there are alternatives to the tedious and
                time-consuming process of loading a demo from a diskette or a
                hard disk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Original hardware can be modified to use modern and fast storage
                media. The floppy drive can be replaced on retro computers like
                the Atari ST with a <em>Gotek drive</em> (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-92">figure 92</a>). This is a
                USB floppy emulator, a replacement unit that has a USB slot and
                a digital display. Users insert their USB thumb drive with
                previously salvaged disk images. Provided the correct firmware
                is used, the Atari ST will "believe" that an original floppy
                drive is attached and read the disk images stored on the thumb
                drive as if they were real disks.

                Old hard disks can be replaced with an <em>UltraSatan</em> which
                provides two SD cards slots with a standard SATA hard disk
                interface and a converter to the SCSI interface needed in the
                ST. The name is derived from the SATA interface and is not
                related to Satanism, but likely rather to the levity of naming
                devices in a hobbyist scene.
              </p>
              <p>
                The UltraSatan uses the SD cards as virtual hard drives, so the
                computer recognizes them as hard disk partitions (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-94">figure 94</a>). The Atari
                ST has legacy limitations, so it cannot handle the massive SD
                card storage available nowadays. Even comparatively small volume
                SD cards with only 2GB are too large for the computer to
                recognize. There is a solution to that: by partitioning each SD
                card into multiple partitions that are no larger than 512MB, the
                ST will identify them as multiple hard disks.
              </p>
              <p>
                The UltraSatan is simply attached to the Atari's external hard
                disk port as an external device or to the internal SCSI/ACSI
                port as an internal device with an appropriate SCSI terminator.

                A1.5 Pretending to Be Worse Than They Are: Emulating Obsolete
                Systems on Modern Computers
              </h3>
              <p>
                This section has now arrived at the "silver bullet" of software
                preservation: <em>emulators.</em> The term emulator is derived
                from the Latin "aemularia" and means "to imitate." This
                technology simulates another computer system in certain aspects.
                Software emulators are applications that emulate a computer or
                an operating system and thus make it possible to use the
                software for this computer on another computer with a different
                architecture, e.g., allowing the execution of programs written
                for older home computers on a PC. Or, put simple, a vastly more
                powerful modern PC pretends to be an old computer so that the
                original software can run.
              </p>
              <p>
                In its resources for digital preservation, the National Library
                of the Netherlands outlines the use of emulation for the
                purposes of digital preservation and identifies the key aspects:
                "Developing an emulator is a precise and time-consuming task,
                especially because the emulated environment must appear
                authentic and must function accurately too."
              </p>
              <p>
                Fortunately, even during the Atari ST's original production run,
                several emulators recreated the ST's processor, the Motorola
                68000, and Atari's graphical user interface, GEM, on a wide
                variety of platforms. Three of these original emulators,
                PacifiST, GEMulator, and WinSTon, have long been discontinued
                and development has stopped. The two best emulators have
                persevered and are still being developed to this day:

                accuracy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Steem and Hatari use common code elements and provide a
                similarly high compatibility level with the original hardware,
                however, their respective user interfaces have taken different
                approaches.
              </p>
              <p>
                Steem prioritizes a convenient configuration and ease of use.
                Steem's file manager allows users to comfortably handle disk
                images and even use folders on the host PC's drive to emulate
                Atari ST hard disk partitions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Both emulators offer a snapshot function, meaning that a
                complete memory image of the emulated ST can be saved to file at
                any time. This is not only a useful feature for gamers to save
                the state of their game, but it also helps to preserve
                configurations of the right version of the operating system
                (Atari TOS) and a specific application, saving time to find the
                right combination.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the graphics options are concerned, Hatari is superior to
                Steem. It can be used in fullscreen mode, thus hiding the host
                computer's native operating system. Then, it looks like the ST
                in all its retro glory. Steem only works reliably in a window
                with a fixed size.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hatari relies heavily on keyboard shortcuts and has a rather
                old-fashioned user interface. Hatari runs on Windows, macOS, and
                Linux (see <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-95">figure 95</a>).
                Support for the latter means that there is also a version of
                Hatari for the Raspberry Pi that comes preinstalled in the retro
                computer emulation package
                <em>RetroPie.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                The emulator alone only emulates the bare hardware. You need an
                operating system, i.e., TOS (an acronym with two alternate
                explanations, either as "the operating system" or as "Tramiel
                Operating System," named after the former CEO of the Atari
                Corporation, Jack Tramiel). All TOS versions are still protected
                by copyright, and the rights are held by the German Milan
                Computer GmbH and the Swiss company, Medusa Computer Systems.
                Despite this, it is easy to find all versions of TOS as IMG
                files for download on the Internet. However, in a commercial
                setting such as an archive exhibition, their use is legally
                questionable.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is an alternative: EmuTOS, a largely compatible and free
                re-implementation of TOS for Atari emulators. It is based on the
                GEM source code from original TOS developer Digital Research and
                works with both Steem and Hatari. EmuTOS supports all ST and STE
                models.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the purpose of preserving Atari ST demo art, the disk images
                of the demos can be run in Steem or Hatari. The disk images can
                be generated (see above) or obtained from the demo archives at
                pouet.net and demozoo.org.

                Emulation is the easiest solution, but this convenience comes at
                the price of authenticity. Audience do not see what the actual
                piece originally looked like. Their visual experience is severed
                from the original era of the art. This effect is particularly
                strong, if an exhibited piece runs on a large LCD screen. Cory
                Arcangel describes the aesthetic issues of emulation:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "The problem with emulation outside of preservation is that
                people, the public-don't understand emulation. So if a gallery
                or museum wanted to run an emulated version I would be really
                standoffish about it, because I think the point of one of those
                pieces is so people can see the Nintendo. It's similar to the
                magnet on the TV; it's like, OK, here's where the signal is
                coming from, and I think when you run it on an emulator you
                really lose that. So really the emulation right now is for the
                specialized audience on the Internet who understands that it
                normally would be a Nintendo. But the gallery or museum audience
                doesn't understand that. The hope is that in twenty or thirty
                years audiences will understand emulation, so you could show an
                emulated version in a museum and it wouldn't be such a big
                deal."<sup

                A1.6 FPGA: Dedicated Field Programmable Gate Arrays
              </h3>
              <p>
                The FPGA platforms <em>MiST</em> and <em>MiSTer</em> provide
                hardware-supported emulation (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-96">figure 96</a>). These are
                specialized devices for replicating old hardware systems. As an
                analogy, the "brain" does not consist of a classic processor but
                a field programmable gate array (FPGA). It can be fed with a
                description of specific hardware written in a specialized
                language. It then imitates the function of this hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the names MiST and MiSTer suggest, the devices were developed
                to emulate the Amiga and the ST. Enthusiasts have provided the
                FPGA implementation of the Atari ST and released their results.
                A ready FPGA core of the ST is available for MiST and MiSTer. It
                is copied to an SD card, and the FPGA boots the core to adapt
                the gate arrays to imitate the ST's hardware. The advantage of
                FPGA is that it is much closer to the hardware, which leads to a
                potentially more accurate emulation.

                A1.7 Demo Recreations Using Modern Technologies
              </h3>
              <p>
                The final method of conservation is the most laborious and
                time-consuming. Enthusiasts have started to meticulously
                recreate their favorite demos, not on the original hardware, but
                using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript). They
                convert the original graphics and sound files to modern formats.
                Then, they program the web version to be as precise of an
                imitation of the original with all its quirks and shortcomings.
              </p>
              <p>
                The big advantage is that these web recreations can be made more
                widely available and are easily accessible to a large audience
                by simply making them available on a website.
              </p>
              <p>
                This method requires the most effort; it cannot be done on a
                large scale without a great effort and expenditure of work
                hours. Yet, the final results are underwhelming on a modern
                computer. They miss the point of the original demos because they
                do not use the capabilities of the machine they are running on
                to their utmost power. Put in casual terms: they are the
                fanfiction of demo art.

                A1.8 Saved from Failing Media, But Not from Obscurity
              </h3>
              <p>
                These were the two pillars for the conservation and preservation
                of demo art: first, saving the files and their components from
                the original data media, and the other running the demos as
                authentically as possible on their native system or modern
                hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are hundreds of different computer platforms used to
                create demos with thousands of demos created; many of them are
                obscure. Merely saving them is only half the journey. An
                archival effort should build on the salvaged files and provide
                documentation and analysis. A sustainable archive of demo art is
                so much more than a list of saved files.
