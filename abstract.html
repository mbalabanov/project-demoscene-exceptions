                <h3>Shattering the Limits: How Technical Limitations Pushed the Early Demoscene to Produce Digital Art
                </h3>
                <h4>MediaArtsHistories 2020</h4>

                <h3>Contents</h3>
                <p>Demos are compact computer programs that generate visuals and sound. They are examples of real-time
                    algorithmic art showcasing the artistic, musical and programming skills of their creators, and can
                    be appreciated by computer experts and a general audience alike for their ingenuity, their effects
                    and the creativity in overcoming technical limitations. How did technical limitations and cultural
                    boundaries enable and motivate the process of creating computer art in the demoscene of the 1980s?
                </p>
                <p>The focus of this master's thesis is on the demo-group The Exceptions during three years from 1987 to
                    1989 in the Atari ST demoscene. These were the formative years of the Atari ST demoscene, and The
                    Exceptions were the first to produce demos on this computer system. </p>
                <h4>Thriving Due to Limitations</h4>
                <p>Technical limitations and societal restrictions imposed on art have a negative impact on the process
                    and outcomes of art creation. Yet the demoscene's ability to thrive despite technical limitations
                    and cultural restrictions transformed it from a community of hobbyists in the 1980s into a media
                    arts subculture and key group in the open-source movement and computer games industry. Despite its
                    relevance for the development of the media arts, media art history has not fully explored and
                    documented the demoscene.</p>
                <h4>Cultural Heritage and Its Relevance</h4>
                <p>Currently, the digital subculture of the demoscene is in the process of being included as the very
                    first digital culture on the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. The ethos of early
                    demo-makers anticipated the later open-source movement with the idea that the machine they own
                    should be completely controlled by the developers and all its capabilities should be discovered and
                    used.</p>
                <p>This subculture's early history is a defining aspect of the history of the digital arts and an
                    important chapter in computing history.</p>
                <h4>Methods and Approach</h4>
                <p>A media art history examination of the demoscene in its entirety would exceed the scope of a thesis.
                    Hence, this thesis approaches the historic demos created by The Exceptions in 1987, 1988, and 1989
                    as digital artifacts for detailed analysis. Images, music, scrolling text, and the demo effects will
                    be subject to analysis. The technical limitations that were exceeded and broken will be discussed.
                    The analysis will include first-hand accounts of the demo-makers The Exceptions as told from the
                    time of the demos' creation TO decades after the fact. Some of the areas discussed are the
                    motivation behind the images, the reason for targeting the Commodore Amiga as a competing system,
                    and how the technical limitations were circumvented and exceeded.</p>
                <p>The demo analysis will show how the makers created demos by virtue of their motivation to exceed
                    machine limits and how the competition between different demo-groups created the demoscene on the
                    Atari ST. The final conclusion is that limitations are a catalyst in the creation of art, motivating
                    innovation. Finally, the thesis will explore the different methods for the conservation of demo art
                    and provide an in-depth case study on the creation of a prototype digital platform to archive demo
                    art.</p>
