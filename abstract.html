                Demos can be defined as compact computer programs that generate
                visuals and sound. They are examples of real-time algorithmic
                art showcasing the artistic, musical, and programming skills of
                their creators, and can be appreciated by computer experts and a
                general audience alike for their ingenuity and the creativity in
                overcoming technical limitations. The enthusiasts and artists
                who create demos are loosely organized in the “demoscene” to
                hone their skills by creating art that takes computers to their
                technical limits. This thesis examines the question of how
                technical limitations and cultural boundaries enabled and
                motivated the process of creating computer art in the demoscene
                of the 1980s.

                The focus of this master's thesis is on the demo-group The
                Exceptions during the years 1987 to 1989 in the Atari ST
                demoscene. These were the formative years of the Atari ST
                demoscene, and The Exceptions were the first to produce demos on
                the computer system.

              <h4>Thriving Due to Limitations</h4>
              <p>
                Technical limitations and societal restrictions imposed on art
                have a negative impact on the process and outcomes of art
                creation. Yet, the argument of this thesis is that the
                demoscene's ability to thrive despite technical limitations and
                cultural restrictions transformed it from a community of
                hobbyists in the 1980s into a media arts subculture and key
                group in the open-source movement and computer games industry.
                Despite this, media art history has not fully explored and
                documented the demoscene.

              <h4>Cultural Heritage and Its Relevance</h4>
              <p>
                Currently, the digital subculture of the demoscene is in the
                process of being included as the very first digital culture on
                the list of UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage. The ethos of
                early demo-makers anticipated the later open-source movement
                with the idea that the machine they own should be completely
                controlled by the developers and all its capabilities discovered
                and used.
              </p>
              <p>
                As is demonstrated in this thesis, this subculture's early
                history is a defining aspect of the history of the digital arts
                and an important chapter in computing history.

              <h4>Methods and Approach</h4>
              <p>
                A media art history examination of the demoscene in its entirety
                would exceed the scope of a thesis. Hence, this thesis
                approaches the historic demos created by The Exceptions during
                1987 through 1989 as digital artifacts for detailed analysis.
                Images, music, scrolling text, and demo effects will be subject
                to analysis, and the technical limitations that were exceeded
                and broken will be discussed. The analysis will include
                first-hand accounts of the demo-makers, The Exceptions, as told
                from the time of the demos' creation to decades afterwards. Some
                of the areas discussed are the motivation behind the images, the
                reason for targeting the Commodore Amiga as a competing system,
                and how the technical limitations were circumvented and
                exceeded.
              </p>
              <p>
                The analysis of the demos will show how the makers created demos
                by virtue of their motivation to exceed machine limits, and how
                the competition between different demo-groups created the
                demoscene on the Atari ST. The thesis concludes that limitations
                are an important catalyst in the creation of art and thus
                motivate innovation. Finally, in the light of media art history,
                the thesis will explore the different methods for the
                conservation of demo art and as a result provides an in-depth
                case study on the creation of a prototype digital platform to
                archive demo art.
