                <em>The Exceptions</em> were not only the first demo-group on
                the Atari ST but from 1987 to 1989 they were the most prolific
                one on the system. Their name was abbreviated as TEX (which
                could easily be misread as "rex" in their logo). They came from
                what was then West Germany.

              <p>
                Erik Simon, Jochen Hippel, and Udo Fischer were the core group
                of The Exceptions. They were all born in the mid-1960s and early
                1970s and were young adults by the time the Commodore 64 was
                released in Europe.
              </p>
              <p>
                They adopted "handles," or aliases. Erik was <em>ES,</em> which
                were not only his initials but also the German word for "it."
                Jochen was <em>Mad Max,</em> named after the post-apocalyptic
                movies with Mel Gibson (who was not a controversial figure at
                the time). Udo was <em>-ME-.</em> The Exceptions' other members
                were Michael Raasch, who called himself <em>Daryl</em> after the
                1985 science-fiction movie <em>D.A.R.Y.L.,</em> and Gunter Bitz,
                who called himself <em>6719,</em> the postal code of his
                hometown Kirchheimbolanden in the Rhineland-Palatinate
                (Rheinland-Pfalz).

                Erik Simon's specializations were the graphics, concept work,
                and writing the text of the scrolling messages. In ST-NEWS, he
                later described his own contribution as:

              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "...my specialties are graphics and the invention of effects
                that should be realized by the aforementioned programmers and
                that (in the best cases) just make them moan and groan."

                Udo, Gunter, and Michael were the programmers of the demo and
                intro effects. They wrote their routines in assembly code using
                an assembler which was as close as you could get to the native
                instructions of the processor before resorting to the pure ones
                and zeros of machine code. Their areas of specialization were
                raster interrupts, soft-scrolling, and speed-optimizations,
                i.e., they could program the ST to show more colors than it
                should, scroll the screen faster and smoother than it was meant
                to, and could optimize the efficiency of code so well that it
                would be executed faster.

                Jochen, a.k.a. Mad Max, was the sound programmer and composer of
                The Exceptions. His instrument was the Atari ST's admittedly
                subpar sound chip Yamaha YM2149F (also produced as General
                Instruments AY-3-8910). Mad Max managed to conjure sounds and
                music that were reserved for much more advanced sound
                processors.

                who occasionally contributed.

              <p>
                The Exceptions first came together around the legendary
                Commodore 64. This 8-bit machine became one of the best-selling
                computers of all time.<sup

                Udo Fischer and Erik Simon tried their hand at their first demos
                on the C64. Udo programmed while Erik painted. Their first
                attempts were solely of a hobbyist nature.
              </p>

                When the Atari ST sporting the blazing-fast Motorola 68000
                processor was announced in 1985, they knew that this was the
                right machine to move to the new generation of 16-bit computers.
                Before the ST became available in Europe and the price dropped
                to an affordable level for The Exceptions, they started learning
                to write assembly code for the Motorola 68000 on the Commodore
                64. It was slow and barely useable since a far less powerful
                machine (the C64) simulated the processor of a much more
                powerful one (the Atari ST). Yet, this allowed Udo Fischer to
                learn the assembly instructions and get his first experience on
                the new processor without yet owning the new computer they
                yearned for.<sup

                Later in 1985, a friend of Udo and Erik, Heinz, acquired an
                Atari ST. There was not much software available this early in
                the machine's life. Udo and Erik knew that they had a chance to
                try their routines that they painstakingly created in the
                simulated 68000 on the C64. They visited Heinz and ran their
                first small programs on the real Atari ST.

                screen, however, did not simply start getting filled, but was
                just filled the moment our program started. We yelled like
                madmen, and our shrewd conclusion was: 'This processor must be
                fast!'"

              <p>
                Since it would take a while for any of them to get an Atari ST,
                Udo wrote and assembled his programs on the C64, and on weekends
                went over to Heinz's place to type the code into the ST. In
                1986, Udo and Erik got their own Ataris. Udo purchased a model
                with a monochrome monitor with a stable black-and-white display
                that would allow him to spend prolonged periods of time in front
                of the ST without overly burdening his eyes. Erik wanted to
                produce color graphics using one of the early paint apps
                available, <em>NEOchrome,</em> so he bought a color monitor with
                his system. As a development environment, they found the
                <em>K-Seka</em>
                assembler by Kuma Soft.
              </p>
              <p>
                Udo found one of the first German books about the hardware of
                the Atari ST, <em>ST Intern,</em> by the now-defunct publisher
                Data Becker from Düsseldorf. Apparently, the book had a few
                factual errors in it, but this did not prevent Udo from learning
                to produce fast code on his new computer. Hence, the Exceptions
                were born.

                At first, TEX was part of the cracker scene, who cracked the
                copy protection on games and pirated them. Of note, they only
                ever cracked a handful of games on the Atari ST and added
                cracktros and intros to them. They quickly moved on to only
                producing demos, and later still became commercial games
                developers with their own company called Thalion.

                In other parts of Germany, the Scandinavian countries and the
                Netherlands more demo-groups formed following the example of The
                Exceptions. The resulting works were not only demos, intros, and
                cracktros, but also regularly published diskmags (disk
                magazine), an enthusiast periodical publication distributed on a

                Markku Reunanen describes the relationship between demo-makers

                As the "underdogs," the Atari ST demo-makers felt the need to
                attack the Amiga and its demoscene. While this was noticed by
                the Amiga scene, they did not reciprocate, because the Commodore
                Amiga started to sell large quantities with the introduction of
                the Amiga 500 in 1987, a year that the sales of the Atari ST
                still exceeded the Amiga.<sup

                Sales of the Commodore machine started to outpace the Atari

                These are important figures because the number of machines in
                homes determines the number of potential demo developers. Once
                the Amiga continuously outsold the ST, there was no concept of
                true competition in the eyes of Amiga demo-makers. They were
                making demos not only for the
                <em>technically superior</em> platform but also for the more
                <em>successful</em> platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reunanen describes his observations on the key differences
                between the two scenes as well:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                "Some specialties existed, however. The extensive use of
                interactive selection screens in Atari megademos is a property
                virtually unique to ST demos. Significant effort was invested in
                the selection screens alone."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The <em>selection screens</em> Reunanen refers to are the
                screens that users are presented with for demos that consist of
                collections of different component demos. Multiple groups of
                demo-makers united to create these megademos with different
                graphics and music styles, all packaged in a single demo. Of the
                demos discussed in this thesis, the megademo designation applies
                to the <em>Union Demo.</em> At least on the Atari ST in the
                years from 1987 to 1989, megademos usually did not have many
                recurring elements across all their component demo screens.
              </p>
              <p>Reunanen continues to state:</p>

              <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
                "Atari megademos frequently featured parts of multiple groups,
                which is a rather uncommon feature in the scene as well."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Therefore, we can determine that the Atari ST demoscene had two
                distinguishing components:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The perception of being an underdog to the Commodore Amiga,
                  which resulted in a friendly, and sometimes unfriendly,
                  rivalry, but only in one direction. The ST was mostly ignored
                  by the Amiga scene.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The prevalence of megademos on the Atari ST, where multiple
                  demo-groups join forces to create a collection of demos that
                  are packed together and can be accessed via a selection
                  screen.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The Exceptions had purchased their 16-bit computer, the Atari
                520ST. Their loyalty was towards this machine, and they were
                just starting to learn how to program the "guts" of their
                machine. The scene was set: they were drenched in the pop
                culture, the big ideas and fantasies of the day, the competition
                was clear, and the game was about to start. In 1987, they
                created their very first stand-alone demo for the Atari ST.

                2.4 Conclusion: Limitations of Early Home Computers
              </h3>
              <p>
                Computers in the 1980s had a wide variety of capabilities based
                on their hardware and retail price. The Atari ST range of
                computers was engineered in a rush to market in order to compete
                in the emerging 16-bit computer sales war. To meet the schedule
                and keep costs down, the engineering team had to use many
                off-the-shelf components. The ST was released on time, but the
                process resulted in a machine that was less capable than its
                16-bit competitors.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, the Atari ST became the underdog of the 16-bit
                machines. It had color limitations, large screen borders, no
                dedicated graphics chips for horizontal or vertical scrolling,
                no hardware support for sprites, and a sound chip that was used
                in 8-bit computers. The most similar, yet more capable,
                competing system was the Amiga produced by Commodore.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions started out as a cracking group on the Commodore
                64. They switched over to the Atari ST and started creating
                intros to their cracked games to prove that the ST could meet
                the capabilities of the Commodore Amiga. Comparable to digital
                graffiti, this tribalism for certain computer systems led to
                competition between systems for the best intros and demos, and
                on the same system, led to competition between crackers,
                intro-makers, and demo-makers to create the most impressive
                intros and demos.
