            <h2>Chapter 3. Contest of Champions: Analysis of the Demos</h2>

            <p>
              This section is the center piece of the thesis, it provides a
              detailed analysis of the demos produced by The Exceptions and by
              other relevant demo-groups on the Atari ST in the scoped time
              period. The analysis will be based on hermeneutic interpretations
              of the demo art and its component images, music, and scrolling
              text from the perspective of what they depict, technical aspects,
              the tone, and the cultural perspective. As a means to evaluate the
              sigificance of demo art for media art history, the objective here
              is to learn about the limitations that the demo-makers managed to
              circumvent, the techniques they employed, and the messages they
              sent out to their audiences.
            </p>
            <p>
              The source of the demos is pouet.net, the historic demoscene
              archive. Where possible, the demos were screened on the original
              hardware, a modified Atari Mega STE. This is a machine that was
              released five years after the Atari ST, so it is not 100%
              compatible. If a demo could not be run on the original hardware,
              it ran in the open source Atari ST emulator Hatari on MacOS and on
              the FPGA retro computer MiST (see Appendix I on the conservation
              and preservation of demo art for further information on
              emulation).

            <h3>3.1 The Year 1987: The Humble Beginnings of the Demo Scene</h3>
            <p>
              The analysis starts with the demos on the Atari ST in 1987. While
              the Atari 520ST was introduced in 1985, it was released to a wider
              audience only in 1986. The Atari Corporation first provided small
              programs demonstrating the capabilities of the Atari ST for use at
              the point-of-sale, but these were limited to image slideshows
              showcasing the advanced graphics without any software tricks. The
              very first demo produced by crackers and demo-makers was released
              in 1987 by The Exceptions. It was the inconspicuously named
              README.PRG. The demo-group released three more demos in 1987 after
              README.PRG: The Little Sound Demo (LSD), the Little Color Demo
              (LCD), and the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.
            </p>
            <h4>3.1.1 README.PRG</h4>
            <p>
              In March 1987, The Exceptions released the very first demo on the
              Atari ST, README.PRG. The file was barely 80KB. Files named README
              usually contained instructions or supplementary information
              relevant to an application, so users would normally open this kind
              of file before using an application. The Exceptions did not
              provide a text file; they provided an executable program. The
              first time when users ran it in 1987, it baffled them.
            </p>

            <p>

              (screenshot)
            </p>

            <p>
              Compared to later demos, it was rather restrained in its scope.
              README.PRG was a single-screen demo with scrolling text. Roughly
              80% of the screen was occupied by an image created by Erik Simon
              (ES). Along the lower fifth, a scrolling text ran across an
              animated background.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.1.1 The Elements of Design of the Readme Demo</h5>
            <p>
              The static graphic shows a lush fantasy landscape. The image's
              central piece is a red dragon with wings spread wide perched on
              the base of the picture. Visible in the distance behind the dragon
              was a temple made of square gray stones with what looks like a
              statue of a serpent's head hanging above the portal. Behind the
              temple's golden dome, one can see gnarly gray mountains with other
              dragons flying between them. The sky is cloudy, but a bright
              gradient of colors stretches from the clouds to the mountains.
            </p>
            <p>
              The red dragon's arms are resting on a box with the initials "TEX"
              inscribed on it; the dragon's tail is tenderly wrapped around it,
              somewhat obscuring the letters. The dragon tilts its head
              downwards and breaths fire onto a red-and-white sphere, clearly
              identifiable as the Amiga ball from the earliest demos on the
              competing machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing that Atari ST users notice on the colorful screen
              are the many colors— more than the 16 colors that Atari ST usually
              displays. The sky's gradient already shows more than three dozen
              colors far surpassing the ST's color limit — the hues of the
              temple, the shades of the mountains, the saturated green of the
              meadows that are interfused with rich blue streams of water. And
              in the center stands the red dragon with its venomous crimson
              tones, ripping into the landscape with flames engulfing the symbol
              of Amiga's superiority. While the dragon might well be interpreted
              as the Atari ST, it could well be the demo-makers themselves.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.1.2 The Scrolling Text</h5>
            <p>
              These are the full contents of the demo's scrolling text with all
              its charming errors (though I did take the liberty to convert it
              to mixed case since the original was in all caps):
            </p>
            <p>
              "Hi there!!! Welcome to the first demo screen produced by the
              Exceptions (TEX)! Maybe you remember all those funny little
              programs called "demos" on the good old '64. Here's now the first
              one of it's kind on Jack's good new ST. Yes, we all know that
              these PRG's aren't good for nothing, except for two little
              things... you sit and wonder whats going on with your computer,
              and we're getting a lot of know-how.
            </p>
            <p>The Exceptions are: -ME- and ES</p>
            <p>
              All the code in our demo was written by -ME- (the king of
              interrupts!). Graphics, characterset, colors (many, many colors
              eh?) and text by ES. The music was "lended" from the game
              "Extensor". Try the keys 1 - 5 (0 to escape demo)! We bet that you
              thought a softscrolling like this is impossible on a
              bitmap-machine like the st. But as you see… and it's even running
              on the VBL-IRQ! You don't know what the hell this means? Oh, no
              not again such a C-programmer! Long live 68000-assembly language!
            </p>
            <p>And now, what nobody wants to see: The greetings.</p>
            <p>
              Ok, hi to the few people we know: SSS, Softknight and Indy,
              although he doesn't like the ST... Oh yes: A very special hello to
              all the poor Amiga-owners who can't write assembly programs on
              their pretty lady (haw, haw, haw…)! To finance this program a
              little bit of advertising was necessary: "listen all you people to
              the greatest blues-band on earth: The Dingsbums!!!! Motto: Es werd
              gegroovt un' werd gegröhlt un' mit em Bier de Hals geölt! Gigs
              everywhere round Germersheim!" Let's come to an end. Folks: excuse
              me if there are any "bugs" in the text. I haven't solved enough
              Infocom-adventures yet. Bye for now. We're working on our second
              demo, the shape-out seems to be a little bit difficult. see
              you..."
            </p>
            <p>
              From the outset of this very first demo onwards, the newly formed
              team, "The Exceptions," already formulated their main motivating
              factor for creating demos: to prove that the cheaper computer, the
              Atari ST, is as capable as the pricier Commodore Amiga. Out of
              this perceived position of inferiority, the purpose of their demos
              is not only to look "cool" for the sake of it, but also to beat
              the competing 16-bit platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scrolling text of README.PRG, despite its charming spelling
              mistakes and Germanized English phrasing, already reads like a
              simple manifesto. The graphics artist ES (Erik Simon) praises
              their work, commemorates the achievement of his partner Udo
              Fischer (-ME-), who coded the demo, and sends out greetings to
              their friends. But most of all, The Exceptions show off that they
              achieved something that was thought to be impossible: many more
              colors on the screen at the same time than the Atari ST should be
              capable of displaying and a soft scrolling text across the bottom
              of the screen. The background of the text even scrolls at a
              slightly slower pace, creating a parallax scrolling effect.
            </p>
            <p>
              The central processing unit (CPU) or processor of the Atari ST is
              the Motorola 68000. The same processor also beats at the heart of
              the Commodore Amiga, the original Apple Macintosh, and the Sega
              MegaDrive/Genesis.
            </p>
            <p>
              All of these effects were only possible by coding natively and
              directly on the processor in assembly language, the last
              human-readable but still very cryptic language before reaching
              actual machine code composed of ones and zeros. The disadvantage
              of assembly language is that it requires deep knowledge of the
              computer's inner workings and requires a greater proficiency than
              the so-called higher programming languages, like C, Pascal, and
              BASIC. The big advantage is the sheer speed of execution of
              programs written in assembly language. A good assembler programmer
              is also not limited by any of the formalities and requirements
              that higher programming languages or the operating system impose.
              If an assembly coder manages to find a way to coerce the hardware
              into doing something, then it will work.
            </p>
            <p>
              In their scrolling text, The Exceptions go on to mock anyone who
              cannot write 68000 assembly language, with no lack of pride,
              knowing full well that it is a daunting endeavor. Using a possible
              double entendre, ES calls anyone a C programmer who does not know
              what VBL-IRQ means. This might well be a programmer who writes
              code in the programming language C, or a class c (third-class)
              programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              They go on to ridicule owners of the Commodore Amiga, but there
              seems to be a nod to the superiority of the Amiga. They call the
              machine a "pretty lady" and then exclaim a taunting onomatopoeic
              laugh. This can be read as a sexist, derogatory remark. It is also
              a play upon the Spanish meaning of the word "amiga" as girlfriend.
            </p>
            <p>
              In a latter section of the scrolling text, the writer alludes to
              advertising being necessary to finance the demo; this is quite
              likely tomfoolery. Both Erik Simon (ES) and Udo Fischer (-ME-)
              were fans of a band local to the town of Germersheim in the West
              German province of Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz). They go
              on to recount the motto of the band in German, which translates
              to: "We groove, we shout, and we oil our throats with beer."
            </p>
            <p>
              The text does have the occasional spelling mistake, but English
              was not the writer's first language. The punctuation is an
              interesting mix between German and French. Some of the opening
              quotes were the lower variety („…") commonly used in German, while
              other quotes were a slightly wrong variation of the quotes used in
              French (« … »), but as <…>. This does not mean much, except that
              the text was not proofread for mistakes.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the very end, the writer even apologizes for mistakes in the
              text, calling them bugs. He then continues that he had not yet
              "solved enough Infocom-adventures." Infocom was a US-based
              software company known in the late 1970s through the late 1980s
              for their well-written text adventures, e.g., "Zork, the Great
              Underground Empire", or "The Leather Goddesses of Phobos". These
              were a type of text-based interactive fiction where the player
              reads a description of a situation or scene and then types their
              commands (e.g., GO EAST, GET SWORD, LIGHT FIRE WITH MATCHES) into
              the command prompt. The program interprets the commands, leading
              the player on to different situations or scenes.
            </p>
            <p>
              From 2000 onward, this form would be retroactively named
              interactive fiction. These text adventures were only available in
              English, and they have not been localized to this day because
              merely translating the descriptions would be insufficient. It
              would be required to adapt the text parser, the part of the
              application that interprets the commands, to a language other than
              English. Players who were not fluent in English would learn a lot
              of the language by playing text adventures. They would expand
              their vocabulary and learn how to express themselves in a way that
              the English-language text parser would understand.
            </p>
            <p>
              Before Erik Simon (ES), the writer of the scrolling text, bids
              farewell, he announces the next demo that he and Udo Fischer
              (-ME-) are working on.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.1.3 Technical Limitations Broken in README.PRG</h5>
            <p>
              The README demo broke a number of the Atari ST's technical
              limitations. At this point in time, The Exceptions only consisted
              of Udo Fischer (-ME-) and Erik Simon (ES), so they focused on
              graphics and scrolling. The Atari ST did not have any dedicated
              scrolling hardware capabilities, so programming smooth scrolling
              was up to smart programmers. The computer had a vast palette of
              512 colors but was straddled with the 16 color-limitation. The
              Exceptions managed to produce:
            </p>
            <p>
              • 92 colors on the screen at the same time (from the overall
              palette of 512 available colors)
            </p>
            <p>• Smooth horizontal scrolling at 50Hz</p>
            <p>
              How did The Exceptions manage to get that many colors on the
              screen at the same time? They used a technique called "raster
              interrupts." As the name suggests, this technique combines the
              "raster" method of drawing a screen image on a cathode ray tube
              monitor or television with the ability to "interrupt" a
              processor's work to produce small changes and immediately return
              to the original task.
            </p>
            <p>
              An "interrupt" is a signal from a computer's component sent to the
              main processor (CPU) to halt any operation in progress and to jump
              to a specific routine in memory and do something else. After
              completing the task in the routine, the CPU resumes at exactly the
              point it was interrupted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term "raster" is used to describe the scanlines on a computer
              screen. A computer creates the screen image on the monitor line by
              line by feeding information to the electron beam that travels
              across the monitor or TV screen. This happened 50 times a second
              on the European screens and 60 times a second on US and North
              American screens.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Atari ST had three resolutions. The high and medium
              resolutions were conceived for business applications like word
              processors, spreadsheets, databases, and desktop publishing. The
              low resolution is the one The Exceptions used for their demos (and
              used for most Atari games of the day).
            </p>
            <p>
              The low-res screen is 320 pixels wide and 200 pixels high. This
              area is a large part of the screen, but it does not occupy all of
              the screen because, in the 1980s and early 1990s, computer screens
              had a border around the main image. The smaller image area allowed
              the Atari ST to work with different TV standards (the PAL standard
              in Europe with a slightly larger available area but a lower
              frequency of 50Hz, and the NTSC standard in North America, with a
              small area but a higher screen refresh rate of 60Hz). The borders
              also keep the main image in the center of the screen, away from
              the curvature of the TV/monitor tube where it would suffer from
              less distortion (which was much greater towards the edges).
              Effectively, it means that around 75% of the screen area is
              actually available to use.

            <h5>3.1.1.4 Adapting the Scanline</h5>
            <p>
              A "raster interrupt" is an interrupt that is deliberately
              triggered when the electron beam that draws the raster of
              scanlines is at a certain scanline on the screen. The interrupt
              sends the processor to a routine that produces a change in the way
              the scanline is drawn, e.g., change the border color or the
              complete palette before the processor proceeds to the next
              scanline. When the change induced by the interrupt has been
              registered, the processor resumes its previous task under the new
              conditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this case, the next scanline is drawn with a changed set of
              colors. This happens so quickly that the user does not notice any
              delay but is presented with much more colorful graphics than they
              thought possible. Unfortunately, the more interrupts a processor
              has to handle, the less time it can spend on other tasks. If the
              processor has to switch color palettes at every scanline, it will
              suffer a slight loss of performance. Precise timing is necessary
              to achieve the desired effects. The switch between two palettes
              must be completely free of flickering and without distortions to
              look convincing.
            </p>

              Figure 23: The palette switches on the main screen of the README
              demo by The Exceptions
            </p>

            <p>
              In the README demo, the ST's palette switches multiple times on
              the main screen. The top section switches parts of the palette
              half a dozen times to accommodate the colorful gradient of the sky
              (only the colors necessary for the clouds and the mountains
              remained constant across most of the sky's palettes). Once the sky
              section no longer needs to be accounted for, the palettes only
              switch a few times until half the screen has been drawn. Gold
              tones for the dome of the temple are needed and different shades
              of gray for the stone blocks of the temple.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bottom half of the image actually has a single 16-color
              palette of greens, blues, and reds. The bottom quarter is occupied
              by the scrolling text. This part has a separate 16-color palette
              composed of yellow tones for the gold of the text and purple
              shades for the background. In actuality, only 14 colors are
              visible in this bottom section because two color registers are
              reserved for the transparency of the letters. The purple
              background looks like it is scrolling in the opposite direction of
              the text.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.1.5 Silky Smooth Scrolling</h5>
            <p>
              The origins of the word "scrolling" might already be forgotten,
              but it actually means "screen rolling." Essentially, the computer
              is moving the contents of the screen in any direction. On the
              Atari ST, it makes no difference if the screen contains graphics
              or characters. For example, when you list a text file on the
              screen, the text scrolls up. More complex scrolling is common in
              arcades and video games, called "soft scrolling." The graphics
              scroll smoothly across the screen without stuttering or jerking.
            </p>
            <p>
              In contrast to other computers of its generation (and even
              previous ones), the Atari ST has special chips or hardware to help
              with scrolling. It has to be done with the ST's processor. To
              achieve this level of smoothness, there are a number of elements
              to be considered. The range of movement should not be too large,
              and the screen should refresh at 1/50th of a second, displaying
              the next phase of the scrolled contents. This is not a random
              figure but the 50Hz (Hertz) refresh rate of a European PAL monitor
              or TV. The US standard used in North America has a refresh rate of
              60Hz. The trick is to have the next phase of the scrolled content
              ready to be displayed before the image is drawn on the screen,
              i.e., in 1/50th of a second.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Exceptions had a hard time figuring out how to produce smooth
              horizontal scrolling on the Atari ST. They found that vertical
              scrolling was easy, but they wanted to use it for their scrolling
              text, where the letters travel from the right to the left so that
              the viewer can read them.
            </p>
            <p>
              The reason for the ST's difficulty with horizontal scrolling is
              the way it creates its graphics. A bitmap image is composed of
              sequences of words (two bytes) in memory. These words contain 16
              pixels of image information. If you want to shift the whole screen
              image or a part of it by one pixel up or down, it is sufficient to
              move the block of memory by a word. The CPU can do this very
              quickly and smoothly. If you want to shift the screen
              horizontally, from right to left (or the other way), then the
              increment of a full word (two bytes or 16 pixels) is too large.
              Shifting the screen by less than a word means the actual bit
              content of each word must be moved. The 68000 CPU can handle about
              32 lines, but anything beyond that would require its full focus,
              leaving no performance capacity for other operations, like music
              or setting up any other contents.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Exceptions needed to avoid any scrolling operations that ran
              on a bit-level. Shifting a full word (two bytes) at a time was not
              smooth enough because that shifts the screen by 16-pixel
              increments that cause a stutter. Therefore, Udo Fischer of The
              Exceptions developed a technique that used eight buffers. The
              screen graphics were stored pre-shifted in two-pixel increments in
              each of these buffers. When the Atari ST needed to display the
              next step of a scrolling image, it retrieved the pre-shifted
              graphics from the next buffer. When seven buffers with the
              pre-shifted images were displayed, the processor shifted the
              original graphic by a full word of 16 pixels and displayed this
              next. To save time needed to copy the buffer contents to the
              screen, The Exceptions used eight virtual screens in memory and
              shifted the address of the graphics memory from one buffer to the
              next. The primary disadvantage of this method was that it was
              extremely memory intensive. At 32KB per screen buffer, this meant
              that the ST had to occupy 256KB in total for all eight buffers to
              achieve smooth scrolling.
            </p>

            <h4>3.1.2 Little Sound Demo (LSD)</h4>
            <p>
              When The Exceptions created their README.PRG demo, the only
              members were Udo Fischer and Erik Simon. They had programming and
              graphics covered, but they did not have a musician. For their
              first demo's music, they simply used the tune from the game
              Extensor, which sounded great and did a good job of using the
              mediocre sound chip of the Atari ST.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Exceptions released their second demo a few months after
              README, they focused on music. In the Little Sound Demo, the
              newest member of The Exceptions, Mad Max Jochen Hippel, was the
              true star. He had faithfully converted tunes from the Commodore 64
              to the Atari ST. Though from a previous computer generation, the
              C64's SID chip was superior to the ST's YM-chip. Mad Max
              meticulously converted a total of 16 minutes of music from games
              on the Commodore 64 that famed composer and chip musician Rob
              Hubbard wrote for International Karate, Monty on the Run,
              Commando, and Flash Gordon. Mad Max composed four more tunes for
              the Atari's YM/AY chip.
            </p>
            <p>
              Rob Hubbard was a commercial music composer for video games, and
              at the time, was still actively writing music for 8-bit systems.
              His music was particularly popular on the Commodore 64, where he
              managed to write some of the most exciting game music that often
              exceeded the game in quality. In many cases, users would purchase
              games specifically because the game music was written by Hubbard.
            </p>
            <p>
              He was well known in the niche circle of gamers in the 1980s, in
              2016, Hubbard received an honorary doctorate from Abertay
              University for his gaming music. In 2019, Hubbard performed his
              8-bit music rearranged for a full classical orchestra in Hull. But
              in 1987, writing music that was as good as Hubbard's was the Holy
              Grail in the demoscene. And the Little Sound Demo, naughtily
              abbreviated as LSD, lived up to this promise.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              The demo still only featured one screen and a scrolling text. The
              top half showed a cartoon depiction of the Atari ST with eyes and
              a mouth spitting a music note on a Commodore 64 that itself had a
              look of bemusement, sticking out its cartoon tongue when hit by
              the note. The right showed the logo of The Exceptions and the name
              of the demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The graphics were not the demo's strong suit; rather, it was the
              sound. Users could hit the keys A to L on their Atari's keyboard
              and listen to faithful conversions from game music composed by Rob
              Hubbard and four original pieces by Mad Max. The music conversion
              was reasonably faithful, given the SID-chip's superiority over the
              ST's limited YM-chip. This was Mad Max's first attempt, and his
              efforts would improve in later demos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scrolling text was again full of bragging, but with no
              greetings to other demo teams. Here is the full text, again
              changed to mixed case for better readability.
            </p>
            <p>"Here we go again!!!</p>

              TEX smashes your monitor speakers once more! Please connect your
              amplifier to the Atari to get totally stoned! Play it loud and
              hear the songs completely.
            </p>
            <p>
              We know that you've thought the ST's sound chip is trash (to say
              the truth it really is trash). But now listen to the things we've
              done to this poor IC. The music routine was programmed by our new
              member Mad Max (not the Frankfurt guy). We're now able to simulate
              most of the commands from the Rob Hubbard synthesizer on the C-64.
              As you can hear we're neatly near the original tunes.
            </p>
            <p>
              Are you sorry selling your '64 or do you dream about the good old
              times playing International Karate with bad graphics but with
              super sound?
            </p>
            <p>Don't panic.</p>
            <p>Here's LSD for your ears!</p>
            <p>
              Some tunes are incomplete because you can imagine how difficult it
              is to reach all the effects of the SID. But Mad Max is working all
              day long, the results will hit your ears soon.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              The Exceptions were full of praise for their newest member. The
              team had found its musician, and they were ready to produce the
              next demo with even more music.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.2.1 The Elements of Design of the Little Sound Demo</h5>
            <p>
              The intention of the graphic is clear: The Atari ST acts defiantly
              towards the Commodore 64. The execution is anything but clear.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you know what the computers look like, then you will probably
              recognize them in their pixel-painted and curved depictions. The
              musical note spewed from the ST to the C64 is also still clearly
              recognizable. Identifying the white cartoon lines that form the
              Atari ST's and Commodore 64's "eyes" and "mouth" is much more
              difficult. The disparity in style between those elements that are
              based on white lines and the full-colored, detailed rendering of
              the computers make a visual connection difficult.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scene is caged in a gray gradient tube frame that restricts
              the contents and serves no discernible purpose. This demo's focus
              is most definitely on the sound and music and not on the graphical
              aspects.

            <h5>3.1.2.2 Meeting Mad Max</h5>
            <p>
              Udo Fischer and Erik Simon had met Jochen Hippel in a computer
              shop in Mannheim, Rhineland-Palatinate. The shop was a meeting
              place, and ironically, customers met each other there to pirate
              games instead of purchasing the software available there. They
              crossed paths again and again in ST user clubs in the towns of
              Ramsen and Bad Dürkheim.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jochen Hippel was 15 years old then. Despite his young age, he
              already programmed music routines on the Commodore 64 that sounded
              very much like the music of Rob Hubbard. Jochen did not own an
              Atari ST yet but was interested in the system. At school, Jochen
              Hippel attracted attention because he had created rock versions of
              Christmas songs in computer class.
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as Hippel got his own Atari ST, the two members of The
              Exceptions pleaded him to join them and create music for their
              demos (and later on commercial games). He simply said, "Why not?"
              and joined them. The team had found their music specialist in Mad
              Max.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.2.3 Converting SID to YM</h5>
            <p>
              To convert the original Hubbard tunes from the C64's SID was
              particularly challenging. There was no music notation of the
              songs, but the programming code could be pulled from the games.
              Mad Max could look at the original composition in hexadecimal code
              but then had to calculate the new code for the Atari ST and
              meticulously convert each note to the capabilities of the more
              limited sound chip.
            </p>
            <p>
              This conversion process ended up being very time consuming, so in
              the Little Sound Demo, the only complete pieces were from
              International Karate, the main theme from Commando and Flash
              Gordon. One of the original pieces by Mad Max was inspired by the
              Marche Funebre by Frederic Chopin.

            <h4>3.1.3 Little Color Demo (LCD)</h4>
            <p>
              The Little Colour Demo was the third demo by The Exceptions in
              1987. According to their scrolling text, they completed it at the
              end of May. It featured even more music that Mad Max had converted
              from games on the Commodore 64. Beyond that, the LCD had two
              scrolling messages—one vertical message and what appeared to be
              the tried-and-tested horizontal scrolling text of the previous
              demos, but with even more colors on screen beyond the machine's
              capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
              To commemorate Rob Hubbard, Erik drew a small graphic of the
              musician saying, "Wow!" because the tunes were even more faithful
              conversions of the original SID music. The vertical scrolling text
              had a barrel distortion effect. The screen looked like it extended
              beyond the borders, which, in fact, was only a fake
              "No-Border-effect" because the graphics did not really protrude
              into the border area. Rather, the border color was changed in the
              lower part of the screen to match the screen content, only
              creating the impression. From a historic perspective, this was the
              first demo to feature a "reset screen"—a screen that could only be
              accessed by pressing the reset button on the side of the Atari ST.
              A testament to the programming capabilities of The Exceptions that
              they could even catch the hardware reset button of the computer
              and deviate it.
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
              The scrolling text of this demo teased that it looked the same as
              in the previous demos and thus was "boring." But then it suddenly
              transformed into multicolors.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users could press the keys A to H to select the music. The
              real-time equalizer in the screen's center showed the real
              operating capacity of each of the YM-chip's three voices. To show
              off even more effects, The Exceptions had added two rotating 3D
              Atari symbols to the left and right of the equalizer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The vertical scroller at the top only had a short text and only
              featured greetings (something lacking in the previous Little Sound
              Demo). The full text of the vertical scroller was quite short:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Here we go again!!! The 3rd demo made by The Exceptions. TEX say
              'hi' to the 1001 crew (especially Steve), DMA, MMC, CSS, SRG,
              BOSS, Alyssa."
            </p>
            <p>
              The horizontal scrolling text erupted in technicolor grandeur, yet
              still used the font established in the first README demo. The
              contents of the horizontal scrolling text lambast the ST's sound
              chip at the same time, lauding the valiant musical efforts of Mad
              Max. It ends with the announcement that The Exceptions will now
              give other demo-makers a chance to produce superior demos:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Ladies and gentlemen. We are proud to present you the latest...
              What?... What are you saying?... Same old boring scrollline?...
              Only 16 colors in it? Ok... Here you are!!! Better now?
            </p>
            <p>
              [At this point, the scrolling text changes to multicolored text.]

            <p>
              Looked left? Looked right? Good! TEX have created their new
              mind-boggling intro: The "LCD" (Little Color Demo)!

            <p>
              Of course haven't forgotten the many people who are panting for

            <p>
              These three TEX members have given their best: -ME- (colorful
              code), Mad Max (magnificent music) and ES (great graphics, daring
              design).
            </p>

              Special thanks to Rob Hubbard (see above) for his funky
              compositions, BST for his fast software, Rolf for lending Mad Max
              his disk drive, Luigi for his good pizza and to Michael for his
              fast Volkswagen...

              We haven't much time for this demo-writing-stuff, because there is
              cracking to do and we're writing on our own game. But we are
              waiting for other demos on the ST! So where are your demos all you
              crackers and machine-code-freaks out there? Come on, show them
              what is possible on the ST!
            </p>
            <p>
              The next demo from TEX will appear when we have seen a better one
              than ours! Oh, yes a "horizontal greeting" to the Blue Adept
              because of his good intro in 'Tenth Frame'. Hang on, Blue Adept!
              Oh Lord, it's now 4:30 o'clock in the morning of the 28.05.87 and
              our third demo is nearly ready. Mad Max falls asleep soon, typing
              the last pieces of 'Human Race 1' and the reast of us will follow
              him in a few minutes.
            </p>
            <p>Bye, bye..."</p>
            <p>
              According to their scrolling text, The Exceptions were going to
              take a break and challenge other demo-makers to produce their own
              demos. This turned out to be a wrong assumption, as they ended up
              contributing to another demo in September of 1987.

            <h5>3.1.3.1 The Elements of Design of the Little Color Demo</h5>
            <p>
              The graphics in this demo are simpler and less playful than in the
              previous demo. The screen is crowded with little sense of
              distribution of the design elements. It looks like the artist
              panicked that any space left unused might be held against him. The
              elegance and use of colors from the first demo's dragon image are
              no longer found—instead to be replaced by generated effects, like
              the vertical scroller and the equalizer as centerpieces yet
              drowned out by the odd repetition of the Rob Hubbard portrait
              image and Atari's spinning Fuji logo in front of the
              barely-recognizable TEX logo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Yet, this is all contrasted by the horizontal scrolling text below
              with its multicolored magnificence, radiating down each of the
              letters making them resemble eccentric chameleons as if they have
              only ever seen Kandinsky's color studies through Vaseline-smeared
              lenses.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.3.2 Atari ST and Music Production</h5>
            <p>
              There are a couple of potential misconceptions about the Atari ST
              and its music capabilities that should be addressed at this point.
              The ST was popular, and much used in the music industry. Musicians
              like Depeche Mode, Jean-Michel Jarre, and the Pet Shop Boys used
              the Atari ST in their studios. It's important to note that they
              used the computer to enter their music compositions into a
              sequencer application. The Atari ST was attached to professional
              music synthesizers via its integrated MIDI (Musical Instrument
              Digital Interface) ports and provided instructions to the
              synthesizers to play the music sequences. The ST was the only
              computer of its time to come with MIDI ports by default.
            </p>
            <p>
              By comparison, the actual sound chip that the computer used to
              generate music and in-game effects was merely pedestrian. Users at
              the time were surprised that a modern computer like the ST had
              such a dated sound chip with the YM-2149F. Mad Max famously said
              about the YM-chip: "Atari built in a totally outmoded sound chip
              into the most modern computer." The Commodore Amiga had far better
              sound hardware, and even the Commodore 64 had a superior sound
              chip.
            </p>
            <p>
              This ambivalence led to the contradictory situation where the
              Atari ST had become the computer for professional musicians
              because it could control instruments, while game developers, chip
              musicians, and demo-makers had a hard time generating music from
              the internal sound chip.
            </p>

            <h4>3.1.4 Super-Neo-Demo-Show</h4>
            <p>
              The Exceptions wanted to become legitimate game developers. While
              talented, they were also young and inexperienced, and therefore
              needed to find the right project and the right game publisher.
              This also meant that they would not have the time to work on any
              more demos in 1987… or so they thought.
            </p>
            <p>
              A friend in Mannheim working under the pseudonym Alyssa discovered
              how to display graphics in the lower border of the ST's screen.
              This intrigued the Exceptions; they wanted to try this in
              practice. Udo Fischer (-ME-) managed to display complete images
              created by Erik Simon and other artists. Then, he utilized the
              lower border for the scrolling text. No more small images due to
              the space requirements of the scrolling text! He even managed to
              add rasters for more colors and to play Mad Max's music with
              digital sound effects.
            </p>
            <p>The Super-Neo-Demo-Show was created.</p>

            <p>
              Figure 29: K. Miller pixel painted an ST version of Smaug (left)
              based on the original
            </p>
            <p>painting by Brothers Hildebrandt (right)</p>

            <p>
              To call this a demo might be a bit of an exaggeration because it
              is actually a slideshow of six images. They were predominantly
              fantasy-themed pixel art produced by Erik Simon and his friends.
              K. Miller pixel-painted an ST version of Smaug from J.R.R.
              Tolkien's The Hobbit based on the original painting by the
              painting brothers Hildebrandt. ES painted the movie poster of the
              animated feature The Last Unicorn and painter Rowena Morrill's
              cover for Piers Anthony's fantasy novel Vision of Tarot. The other
              images are King Tut (a mainstay of 16-bit graphics due to the
              reflections on the death mask) and a Porsche Turbo Carrera.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pictures were predominantly drawn by hand using the classic ST
              paint application NEOchrome. The whole demo screen definitely
              makes use of more than 16 colors, the images themselves were
              pixel-painted within the ST's limitations of 16 colors, proving
              that the right artist can produce great results even within these
              limitations. The paint application NEOChrome's name is referenced
              in the name of the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.

            <p>
              The extraordinary feature of this demo is the premiere on the
              Atari ST. For the first time, the demo-makers managed to remove
              the lower border. The scrolling text occupies a part of the lower
              border. Erik Simon designed a new font for it. The lower part of
              the border is emblazoned with the TEX logo surrounded by little
              propellers spinning animatedly. This serves as proof that there
              really are graphics in the border.

            <p>
              The new font for the scrolling text was necessary due to different
              height requirements in the lower border of the overscan area.
              While it looks cooler, it is definitely harder to read. Here is
              the full text in mixed case (in the demo, it is all caps):

            <p>
              The Exceptions strike again!! Originally we never wanted to write
              a demo again (no time!) But then our friend Alyssa discovered how
              to remove the lower border of the poor tortured Shifter. And so we
              couldn't resist to create the Super-Neo-Demo-Show...
            </p>
            <p>
              Is it necessary to say that this little show was coded by -ME-, or
              that the mighty musix were composed by Robb and programmed by Mad
              Max? Just listen to the fantastic drums! Characterset and some of
              the pic's coming with our neo-show painted by ES.
            </p>
            <p>We think that there is a lot of greetings to do:</p>
            <p>

              (funny conversations on the phone, weren't they, Richard?), DMA,
              Ator (what a shit-exec on that saturday night, eh, Ator?), 42-Crew
              (bet you can't rip this music like some others?), HCC (nice
              demo,boys!), SRG, CSS, SCC and DCA.
            </p>
            <p>
              What's new at TEX? Mad Max has done the music from Bad Cat (he had
              only 4 days and no notes) and he will do the soundtrack from a
              game called "Jules Verne". The titlesong will be a 3-voice
              digitized tune! -ME- will work on our fantasy-role-playing game,
              so does ES. Cracking will be done by Daryl in the future... And
              now i'm giving the keyboard over to -ME- :
            </p>
            <p>
              Hello! I hope this lousy program will work in a few minutes or
              I'll get crazy.... Luckily there are only few raster interrupts to
              manage in our game.... movem.l.. swap.. rte.. aaarghh... So much
              for this time, folks, read the 'read me.txt' and then we wish you
              a lot of fun with the Super-Neo-Demo-Show!!!"

            <h5>3.1.4.1 From Sketchpad via MacPaint to NEOChrome</h5>
            <p>
              Erik "ES" Simon preferred the paint application NEOChrome. It was
              the paint application included with Atari ST's when the computer
              was first released. The application can be compared to a color
              version of MacPaint that was released a year prior on the Apple
              Macintosh. It shares many of the same user interface elements and
              tools. Except for the ST's use of color, the big difference is
              that in NEOChrome the tools were not aligned on the side of the
              screen. They occupied the half the screen together with the color
              palette and zoom function that was always active.
            </p>

            <p>Figure 33: NEOChrome on the Atari ST (screenshot)</p>

            <p>
              NEOChrome's great advantage was its simplicity. It had the main
              paint tools and some limited animation capabilities, but it kept
              Erik Simon focused on the process of painting instead of being
              distracted by too many functions or by the complexity of the tool.
            </p>

            <p>Figure 34: MacPaint 1.0 (screenshot from archive.org)</p>

            <p>
              Both MacPaint and NEOChrome can trace their origin back to
              SketchPad developed by Ivan Sutherland in 1962. This first
              painting and drawing program ever developed. In "Virtual Art: From
              Illusion to Immersion" pioneer of new media art histories Oliver
              Grau describes the importance of Sketchpad:
            </p>
            <p>
              "...Sketchpad enabled the user to draw directly onto the monitor
              with a hand-held lightpen and thus offered the option of
              manipulating images directly on the screen: the basic prerequisite
              for interaction with virtual realities. Sketchpad was the
              precursor of graphics programs such as Adobe Illustrator or
              MacDraw, which replaced the abstract word-commands, that is,
              syntax, interface with the interface of pointing at icons with a
              device, that is, physical action, which was also much easier to
              use."
            </p>

            <p>
              Using a mouse instead of a lightpen but tracing it's heritage
              directly to Sketchpad, the intuitiveness of NEOChrome enabled Erik
              Simon and The Exceptions to create the artwork necessary for this
              completely unexpected demo, the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.
            </p>

            <h5>
              3.1.4.2 Technical Limitations Broken in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show
            </h5>
            <p>
              The greatest achievement of this demo was the premiere of graphics
              in the lower border of the ST's screen. Alyssa opened the lower
              border at the end of the normal screen area on line 199 by briefly
              switching the screen frequency from 50Hz (European standard) to
              60Hz (North American standard) and then switching back to 50Hz.
              The ST's Shifter chip handles the graphics, then displays an
              additional 47 scanlines of graphics. In this way, the
              Super-Neo-Demo-Show had an effective screen resolution of 320 x
              246 pixels, exceeding the limits provided by Atari.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finding a way to open up the bottom border was the first
              elementary step that would later lead to conquering all the other
              screen borders. This gave the first idea of the method to achieve
              what was thought to be impossible on the Atari ST: full overscan,
              i.e., using the full screen without any borders. This is called
              overscan. The Commodore Amiga is capable of using the full
              overscan area out of the box.
            </p>
            <p>
              When Alyssa discovered this trick, he demonstrated it in an intro
              but did not release it to the public. He revealed the technique to
              -ME- of The Exceptions, who used it in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.
              The Atari ST demoscene wracked their brains about how this could
              have been achieved. The Exceptions then disclosed the secret in
              their B.I.G.-Demo in 1988 (this will be described below).
              Interested demo-makers had to sit through the longest scrolling
              text up to that point, because the sync switch technique was only
              revealed at the very end of the text.

            <p>
              Even after their first year of demos, The Exceptions still cracked
              games to distribute them. Game publisher Novagen's Backlash was
              one of them. While the game itself is a commendable first effort
              at producing a cut-down clone of Sega's arcade smash-hit Space
              Harrier, the interesting part was not in the game itself. The
              Exceptions had produced the Backlash Cracktro for the game, an
              intro for the cracked version.
            </p>

              "synclock" rasters across the top and bottom border.

            <p>Right, the adapted in-game credits.</p>

            <p>
              In their cracktro, they had the already established mix of snappy
              music by Mad Max and a variant of their logo proudly resplendent
              across the screen. This was the first time that the top and the
              lower border were used in a demo/intro in a stable way. This
              technique is called "synclock" rasters. While they did not put any
              graphics in the borders, The Exceptions used sophisticated palette
              switching (rasters) across the top and bottom border to show a
              kaleidoscope spread across the whole width. The main display area
              also made "synclocks," the rasters on the left and right to create
              the impression of spreading the background into the borders. The
              technique is particularly difficult because it requires in-depth
              knowledge of the ST's hardware and ample experimentation to
              synchronize (sync) the program code in lock with the electron beam
              of the display.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.5.1 The Elements of Design of the Backlash Intro</h5>
            <p>
              The compositions of the Backlash Cracktro is undoubtedly crowded.
              There was no weighting applied to its elements, no apparent
              thought put into its use of space. The Exceptions' logo is
              rendered in a sparkling golden aesthetic that signals "bling" and
              the impression of having spared no costs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Backlash logo was not created by Erik Simon but taken from the
              game itself. It nevertheless matches the other imagery with garish
              and unbalanced colors. That being said, the image bursts with
              unbridled energy and enthusiasm. It obviously never claimed to
              aspire to be balanced but to unapologetically yell color and form
              at its audiences.
            </p>

            <h5>3.1.5.2 New Demo-Groups on the Atari ST</h5>
            <p>
              Other cracker groups started to produce demos inspired not only by
              The Exceptions. It was a phenomenon that spanned across all
              computer systems, but The Exceptions were one of the major
              motivating factors on the Atari ST. Other demo-makers started to
              match the colors, graphics, music, and sound effects of The
              Exceptions' first few demos, but they also set out to deliver on
              the next challenge: using the top border of the screen. Another
              team, the TNT-Crew around Michael Bittner (Hexagon), came very
              close to be the first to do so. Level 16 and the TNT-Crew were
              already independently working on "synclock" rasters when The
              Exceptions beat them to it with their cracktro to Backlash.
              Despite this, there was still much room for improvement. No one
              had yet put graphics into the top border.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two years later in 1989, the three teams joined forces to become
              part of the Union, a conglomerate of demo-groups.
            </p>

            <h4>3.1.6 The Achievements in 1987</h4>
            <p>
              In the first year of real ST demos, The Exceptions started out as
              a cracking group with a few intro screens in front of their
              cracked games. Then, they released their first demo that broke the
              Atari ST's color limitation. Admittedly, they were not the first
              to do so, as the art application NEOchrome from the Atari
              Corporation had managed to display 222 colors—208 of which were in
              the color picker. However, The Exceptions were the first to
              produce artwork in more than 16 colors. They also combatted the
              prejudice that the Atari ST was not capable of smooth horizontal
              scrolling by producing a horizontal scrolling text.
            </p>
            <p>
              In their first demo, The Exceptions established their rivalry with
              the Commodore Amiga, the technically superior and, at the time,
              far more expensive machine. They aspired to match the technical
              and artistic feats on the computer of their choice. On the one
              hand, this was out of a feeling of having chosen the possibly
              inferior machine; on the other hand, it was playful banter and
              living up to the challenge of achieving some of the same Amiga
              demo effects on the ST that, by any measure, should by not have
              been as capable.
            </p>
            <p>
              In their next two demos, they addressed the limitations of the
              ST's sound hardware by producing music that was comparable to the
              superior SID chip in the Commodore 64. In all of their demos, they
              reached out to a virtual community of crackers and demo-makers,
              handing out kudos and greetings, yet still provoking their peers
              to produce their own works.
            </p>
            <p>
              As the year ended, The Exceptions found their first collaboration
              in a demo. Together with fellow demo-coder Alyssa, they took the
              first step in breaching the limitations of the screen borders by
              removing the lower border of the ST's screen. Again, this was not
              only thought impossible but also something that only the Commodore
              Amiga was capable of.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their demos' graphics and effects were influenced by fantasy and
              science fiction, the aesthetic borrowed from computer games. They
              taught themselves the necessary skills to produce their work. Erik
              Simon (ES) learned to pixel-paint without much to go by, except
              for the finished works of others. Udo Fischer (-ME-) taught
              himself to write Motorola 68000 assembly code, at first not on a
              machine with that processor but using a simulator on the 8-bit
              Commodore 64. Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) mastered music-making by
              copying his idol Rob Hubbard and converting his favorite game
              music to the less capable sound chip of the Atari ST.
            </p>
            <p>
              The language in their scrolling texts was a combination of
              self-aggrandization with some jabs at their peers, yet oddly
              self-deprecating about their work. It sounded like they knew how
              good their skills were, but that the results they delivered always
              fell somewhat short of their aspirations.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 1987, no other full demos were produced on the Atari ST. Peers
              of The Exceptions still released their work as intro screens to
              cracked games, though other demo-groups like Level 16 and the
              TNT-Crew mobilized on the ST. It would take until 1988 for other
              demo-groups to match the work of the team from West Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the fledgling years of the Atari ST—it had only been released
              just over a year before, The Exceptions established themselves as
              the premiere demo-group and spurred others to produce demos on the
              new machine. They networked with their peers in the virtual scene
              and contributed to the first "diskmag" ST-NEWS, a disk magazine
              with articles, scene news, reviews, and programming tips.
            </p>
            <p>
              Whether they intended to or not, in their very first year, The
              Exceptions established the direction that Atari ST demos would
              take over the next years.
            </p>

            <h3>3.2 The Year 1988: Breaking the Limits</h3>
            <p>
              Other demo-groups started to form and release their demos. Many
              came from cracker scene, pirating games, and now started creating
              demos. The Exceptions started to attract attention of computer
              magazines, exposing them to a greater readership. They published a
              series in a commercial print magazine, and they worked on their
              first commercial computer game. Even though it looked like they
              were leaving the demoscene, they definitely wanted to go out with
              a bang. And what a bang it was… a B.I.G. bang!
            </p>

            <h4>3.2.1 B.I.G. Demo</h4>
            <p>
              The B.I.G. Demo was the "Best In Galaxy" demo was the culmination
              of The Exceptions work up to this point. It included more than 100
              tunes converted from the Commodore 64, displayed an increased
              number of colors, and the removed lower screen border.
            </p>
            <p>
              Udo Fischer (-ME-), Erik Simon (ES), and Jochen Hippel (Mad Max)
              were now joined by Michael Raasch (Daryl) and Gunter Bitz (6719)
              to create the first megademo by a single demo-group. The whole
              B.I.G. demo ran on a 512KB machine and was stored on one
              single-sided disk, which usually had a capacity of 360KB.
            </p>
            <p>
              It featured 113 music tunes, three so-called "Psych-O-Screens"
              with the latest effects and a screen with the longest textscoller
              ever packed into a demo so far. In addition, when you pressed the
              reset button on the computer, you would get a hidden custom reset
              screen.
            </p>

            <h5>3.2.1.1 Main Screen</h5>
            <p>
              The main screen showed a selection of all of the 113 music tunes
              converted at an even higher fidelity from games on the Commodore
              64 than in the Little Sound Demo and the Little Color Demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users navigated the song list using the cursor keys. By hitting
              "1," "2," or "3," they changed to the Psych-O-Screens and "B"
              would open the B.I.G.-Scroller.
            </p>

            <p>Figure 37: The main screen of the B.I.G.-Demo (screenshot)</p>

            <p>
              If you listened to all of the music, it would take more than four
              hours, with tunes that range from happy to melancholic, from pop
              to rock. Some of the 113 games on the Commodore 64 are Sanxion,
              Lightforce, Master of Magic, Monty On The Run, Crazy Comets, Thing
              On A Spring, and Auf Wiedersehen Monty.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scrolling text occupied the bottom part of the screen—yes, in
              the lower border. Erik Simon (ES) used a similarly shaped font to
              the Super-Neo-Demo-Show, except that in the B.I.G.-Demo, it was
              much more colorful. It looked like it was embossed in the gray
              background with multicolored highlights running diagonally across
              each letter.
            </p>
            <p>
              As can be seen in the screenshot above, a horizontal tubular
              gradient bar starts within the left border, crosses the main
              display area, and extends into the right border. At the bottom of
              the screen, the shadow covers part of the scrolling text. Both the
              shadow and the bar were achieved by changing the palette registers
              of the border color. This looks like the main contents extend
              across the left and right. Beneath the scroller, even further into
              the lower border, the top half of the logo of TEX protrudes into
              the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first and main screen of the B.I.G.-Demo is gray with some
              multicolored highlights. While not exactly the most exciting
              screen, it's well balanced compared to the previous two demos. It
              provides the instructions to change the music and to switch to the
              impressive parts of the demo: the insanely technicolored
              Psycho-O-Screens.

              Color changes, color movement, colors spanning across the screen

              with color cycling and false perspective effects. At the same
              time, the music from the main screen continues playing
              relentlessly.

            <p>
              In the center of the screen, a gray cube with The Exceptions' logo
              floats in a sea of static. A bar of rainbow colors as wide as the
              full screen with borders moves up and down. When it reaches the
              cube, it stretches behind the logo but in front of the
              front-facing surface of the cube. At the same time, the bar
              protrudes behind the cube's sides—something that, according to all
              laws of perspective—should actually be behind the bar. This
              Esherian contraption is emphasized by the patterned frame of
              colors of a single tone that encase it, though the multicolor bar
              pierces it. All the while the colors of the frame pulsate in
              different colors fading in and out of multiple palettes of related
              shades.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beneath the frame in the area of the screen's lower border, The
              Exceptions repeat their trick with graphics in the overscan area
              by painting in dozens of bright and contrasting colors the words
              "Colorright by," then a gray tubular representation of their TEX
              logo.

            <p>
              This screen shows a platform of a hundred colors floating in the
              blackness of space. On it, different-sized gray spheres cast
              shadows. Rectangular structures lie between the spheres; in the
              negative space of the shadows the rectangles cast, you can see the
              initials ES for the artist Erik Simon, the word TEX for The
              Exceptions, and the two connected musical notes for the music from
              the home screen that continues to play.

            <p>
              This floating island of surreal Daliism does not remain alone for
              long. Starting from the left, multicolored scanlines start to fill
              the black background with vivid radiance until the whole width of
              the screen is covered. Beneath it all, a gray fish inexplicably
              hovers in the Atari ST's lower border.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only now, as the screen is full of interrupted scanlines of
              vibrance, can we see a handful of spherical silhouettes right next
              to the fish. Perhaps these are technicolor bubbles leaving the
              fish's mouth.

              On the second Psych-O-Screen, The Exceptions outdo themselves in
              the multitude of colors on the screen at the same time—a number
              close to the full available spectrum of the Atari ST's 512 colors.
              Surreal shapes in color space are the theme of this image, so it
              makes perfect sense that The Exceptions whimsically post the
              following text above their epic sea of luminance:
            </p>
            <p>
              "We hope they never find the corpse of this guy who said, we
              should make this demo run on monochrome…"

              If one could call the previous Psych-O-Screen merely colorful,
              then this third screen explodes with surreal colors, like a
              digital Jackson Pollock on LSD. The Exceptions push the color
              limits and use as much of the borders as possible. Despite what
              the other screens showed, they had not yet managed to draw actual
              graphics into the side borders. So far, they could only produce
              straight horizontal lines in the left and right overscan area.
              These techniques fill the whole Psych-O-Screen.

              They created a Psych-O-Screen with hundreds of interleaved lines
              of colors horizontally stacked onto the screen. And the lines
              extended into all the borders, except for the top border. This was
              the closest to full overscan that the Atari ST had achieved so
              far.

            <h5>3.2.1.5 Reset Screen</h5>
            <p>
              For the final trick, The Exceptions also included a reset screen.
              When the user pressed the reset button on their Atari ST, the
              computer did not reboot as it should by default. Showing a bomb on
              the screen was the standard way the Atari ST's operating system to
              report a system crash, an error, an exception. But in this case,
              the bomb started to multiply and turn into a cartoon version of
              the system icon. The Exceptions had caught the reset command and
              created a mock screen with cartoon versions of the bomb.

            <p>
              The scrolling text from the home screen can also be read in the
              BIG-Scroller, a separate screen of multicolored text scrolling
              through a dark cave with stalactites in front of it and
              stalagmites in the background.

            <p>
              The "Best in Galaxy" demo had the longest scrolling text ever
              produced in a demo up to that point. To this day, it still counts
              among the longest texts to ever be included in a demo on a 16-bit
              machine. The text was distributed between the main screen and the
              "B.I.G. Scroller" screen. It clocks in at around 41,000
              characters; these are more than 7,000 words at 42KB. Could it be
              that these 42KB were used deliberately because according to
              Douglas Adams in "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy", the
              number 42 is the answer to the ultimate question of life, the
              universe, and everything?
            </p>
            <p>
              Here is the first paragraph of the B.I.G Demo in all its glory,
              changed to mixed-case characters for readability.

              "TEX is back to strike again!! It has been a long time without
              demos, but this time we have succeeded in making the biggest demo
              in the universe: the Best In Galaxy (B.I.G.) Demo, offering 113
              pieces of music with a total playing time of 243'39'
              (approximately 4.1 hours)!!! The whole thing is surrounded by
              stunning graphics, transparent scrolling in the lower border, 512
              color Psych-O-Screens, the smoothest big scroller you ever saw and
              a whole bunch of rasters - quite an achievement, wouldn't you
              say?"
            </p>

            <h5>3.2.1.7 A Reading of the Scrolling Text</h5>
            <p>
              In this section the focus will be on the examination of the
              scrolling text. It is the longest scrolling text in any of their
              demos up to this point, and therefore provides insights into the
              self-proclaimed intentions and thinking of the demo-makers. From
              the onset, it should be established that the majority of the text
              was not produced by the core members of the Exceptions, but rather
              by Richard Karsmakers (Cronos from the Amazing Cracking
              Conspiracy) , the editor of the diskmag "ST-NEWS", who helped the
              demo-makers start their efforts on this demo effort and
              distributed and advertised the demo once it was completed. That
              being said, the demo itself is the work of The Exceptions. They
              would not allow the text to contain anything that contradicts
              their intentions and thinking. The scrolling is summarized below.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the introduction, with a description of the contents and
              features of the demo, the writer states the playtime of all the
              music combined and the length of the scrolling text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, the writer praises the contributors of the music, the code,
              the graphics, and himself, before decrying the Atari ST's YM-2149
              sound chip and graphics hardware. The next section is a list of
              credits for the demo's contributors. This is followed by a list of
              the records broken by the demo, which include the number of pieces
              of music, their total length, the length of the scrolling message,
              and the admirable achievement of compressing it all to a
              single-sided floppy disk.
            </p>
            <p>
              The longest section is the greetings to other members of the
              scene. They range from members of the Atari ST demoscene,
              demo-makers on other systems, developers of commercial software on
              the ST, as well as people at the Atari Corporation who helped
              develop the machine. The language tropes used are playful insults,
              boasts, and other competitive linguistic forms to create sociality
              in the burgeoning demoscene on the Atari ST. Some of the greetings
              have playful remarks, e.g., "Amiga Software Syndicate (though
              they're working on the wrong machine)." While not explicitly
              called out, there are only men on the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three of the "greetings" were disrespectful messages directed at
              groups whom The Exceptions despised for acting dishonorably: the
              cracking groups HSS that distributed programs that were not
              copy-protected by their publishers, but HSS credited themselves as
              having cracked the copy protection. The cracker group named Klu
              Klux Clan Conspiracy in bad taste and Strike Force. Both
              wrongfully credited themselves with the cracks done by others:
            </p>
            <p>
              "HSS (the biggest cocksucker around, that always puts his name in
              programs that others cracked, writes 'cracked by' in loading
              pictures of non-protected software, and that has to watch his
              steps before someone will punch his bleedin' nose)
            </p>
            <p>
              Klu Klux Clan Conspiracy (another one of those queers, writing his
              name in some DMA crackings)
            </p>
            <p>
              Strike Force (a bunch a half-ass fags that put smart-ass intros in
              front of programs they didn't even crack - using routines they
              pinched from others)."
            </p>
            <p>
              Richard Karsmakers and The Exceptions use strong language in this
              section. It is not only offensive but also sexually violent and
              homophobic. It departs in tone from the other sections. This
              strong language was deliberately chosen to attack the cracker
              groups. These paragraphs provide an insight into the unspoken
              "codex" of the scene where claiming merits is the primary
              currency. Wrongfully claiming credit is regarded as a violation of
              this codex. The Exceptions express their anger and dissatisfaction
              with these groups who acted dishonorably.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writers are not native English-speakers. Derogatory vernacular
              in the 1980s was very much directed at sexuality - in this case by
              using "queers" and "half-ass fags" as offensive slurs. From a
              modern perspective this is not acceptable and does not conform to
              our present-day cultural norms. In the context of the times and
              hyper-masculine action movies of the 1980s as watched by this
              generation of young men, the choice of words is offensive, but not
              unusual.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next section, there is an interesting duality. Richard
              Karsmakers' demoscene handle is Cronos, he is part of ACC (the
              Amazing Cracking Conspiracy), and he works on ST-NEWS under his
              real name, yet in this text, he uses his scene handle. To create
              distance between his civilian identity and his scene identity, he
              praises the work of ST-NEWS as though he is not a contributor:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Amazing Cracking Conspiracy ('ST NEWS' is a great magazine! read
              more about it further in this scrolling message. Give our love to
              Willeke!)"
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a mildly profane message to the "motherfucker that
              brought the virus on the ST." Karsmakers elaborates that "words
              fail to tell what we think of him, but I can assure you it ain't
              much good." This was the age when viruses were distributed through
              infected floppy disks, and in some cases, as infected files in a
              Bulletin Board System (BBS). Getting a virus into circulation in
              this way was a very deliberate act. Karsmakers closes with a
              humorous death curse to the virus maker ("…may thunder and
              lightning split your dim-witted skulls into a thousand tiny
              fragments…").
            </p>
            <p>
              The next section lists metrics related to the creation of the
              demo, e.g., the number of developer hours that went into the
              development (2,019 hours), the number of bottles of soft drinks,
              beer, and wine, as well as the cups of tea and coffee that they
              drank during this time. The metrics go on to list materials used
              like diskettes, adhesive strips, paper, and other materials. They
              list all of the computers they used. Oddly enough, this includes
              not only Ataris and Commodore 64s but also a Commodore Amiga and
              an Apple Macintosh II (which at the time was prohibitively
              expensive). They praise the applications they used, which includes
              another praise for the pixel-paint application NEOchrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a tidbit alluding to the demo-makers having to neglect
              their schoolwork due to working on their demo:
            </p>
            <p>
              "82 hours spent cleaning the schoolyard (due to arriving too late
              at school or not properly attending the lessons while developing a
              piece of the demo on chemistry notepaper)."
            </p>
            <p>A long section is dedicated to game musician Rob Hubbard:</p>
            <p>
              "To fill this scrolling text with more or less useful things, I
              think it is more than appropriate to write something about the man
              to whom this demo program is dedicated: Rob Hubbard (music
              programmer on various computer systems amongst which are Commodore
              64, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST)."
            </p>
            <p>
              Below, Karsmakers describes the games that feature Hubbard's music
              and how Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) converted the tunes to the ST.
              Under his pseudonym Karsmakers advertises his own diskmag ST-NEWS:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Through TEX, I was told to give some attention to 'ST NEWS', an
              international disk magazine that is written in English and
              published through Richard of the ACC as a public domain offering."
            </p>
            <p>
              Again, Richard Karsmakers (Cronos) references himself as a
              different person.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writer is still trying to make the text longer, so he starts a
              joke section where he quotes the first joke ever in a scrolling
              message on the Commodore 64 ("Biggles" by FBG): "What does an
              elephant use as a tampon? [...] it's a sheep!" An unfunny and
              mildly offensive joke.
            </p>
            <p>
              What follows is the "obligatory" Amiga vs. ST section. The
              competition between platforms has been a motivating factor for the
              demo-makers on the ST since the very beginning:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Now, many Atari ST users start throwing up when they hear someone
              mentioning the Amiga, and nearly all Amiga users truly think the
              Atari ST is a heap of shit (and the worst thing is that they
              really think it is a heap of shit, whereas Atari ST users just
              talk negatively about the Amiga for jealousy reasons). That
              jealousy, by the way, grows less and less by the day because demo
              programs like this start appearing on the ST, together with more
              and more excellent games and other programs."
            </p>
            <p>
              This section evokes the inherent technological tribalism of the
              demoscene. It specifically addresses the envy that owners of the
              Atari ST feel toward the Amiga's superior capabilities. The text
              states, that Amiga owners look down on the ST for being the
              inferior machine. Certainly, some Amiga owners and demo-makers
              held the Atari ST and, by extension, its owners in contempt, but
              this was not as widespread an opinion in the Amiga demoscene. Many
              ST demos poked attacked the Amiga, yet very few Amiga demos
              attacked the ST.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next section was a useful set of instructions on how to wire
              the ST's monitor port to an amplifier for stereo sound. This was
              followed very late in the scrolling text by the instructions on
              how to use the B.I.G. Demo, how to access the different
              Psych-O-Screens, and how to change the music. To be fair, the
              abbreviated instructions are also listed on the main screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writers then describe the distribution model of the demo. This
              is generally how most demos on most computer systems were
              distributed. They are distributed freely and were part of the
              "public domain" software scene. This is not the same legal term
              for intellectual property that is no longer copyrighted, but a
              by-now-extinct model of software distribution where public domain
              software libraries would distribute software that had explicitly
              been made available by its creators. Usually, the only costs that
              could be charged were for the disk and the effort to make the
              copy, so they remained affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is striking that The Exceptions urge for the free and wide
              distribution of their demo in this section. They also ask for
              donations. This is in 1988, nearly a decade before the prevalence
              of the free and open-source software movement.
            </p>
            <p>
              "Since this demo program is public domain (shareware), it may be
              copied freely. Please copy it to everyone who wants it, as well as
              those who do not particularly want it (they might be grateful when
              they find out what they have copied when they start examining it
              more closely). If you think this demo program might be worth a
              small donation (please, don't take the word 'small' literally!),
              you can send any amount of money..."
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes several hours for the full text to scroll by. If you
              actually read it on the screen while it scrolls, you would have a
              good amount of ghosting in your eyes by the end. Even after
              averting your sight from the screen, you would still see words
              scrolling by.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you sat through the full text, right at the very end, you
              learned the demo-maker Alyssa's secret technique to remove the
              lower border:
            </p>
            <p>
              "Ok. In just a few seconds, -ME- from the Exceptions will start
              explaining how border scrolling techniques work. If you have not
              yet fetched your notepad and pencil, please prepare yourself for a
              mind-boggling piece of constant memory....
            </p>
            <p>Here it is...."</p>
            <p>[...]</p>
            <p>
              "...if you remember our super-neo-demo-show you might have noticed
              a mistake in the pictures in the bottommost line (at the right
              border, 16 pixels are missing.....). These are effects of
              switching off the border. Attention!!! I'm now explaining the
              principles of switching off the border:
            </p>
            <p>
              In the middle of the last line of the normal screen (no. 199
              counted from 0) you must change the syncronization frequency from
              50Hz to 60Hz. This will cause the Shifter to start the right
              border 16 pixles earlier than usual. Then wait till the electron
              beam is in the left border of the next line. There you must switch
              back from 60Hz to 50Hz and there will be no lower border again.
              The greatest problem is the exact timing of the synchronization
              switching!! Your rout will be disturbed by keyboard and timer C
              interrupts. If you don't succeed in timing the program exactly
              there might be 2 different effects: In the easier case you'll see
              the border again for a moment, in the other case you'll see
              curious things happen on your screen (flickering bitplanes and so
              on). An other result of switching off the border is a confused
              video Shifter which is starting the right border 16 pixles too
              soon as he doesn't want to show the last 2 bytes of the video
              memory. Therefore the first address displaid in the first line of
              the 'border' is 31998 bytes behind the first address of the screen
              !! So you must move your graphix 2 bytes to the left for not
              getting 'funny' pictures!
            </p>
            <p>
              Puh !! Writing this text used much less time than making the lousy
              Psycho-2-Screen for which I needed 48 hours of hard programming
              and i don't know how long ES needed to paint the graphix with
              NEOchrome, the best painting program on the ST!!! That's about it,
              folks! The 99th percent of this scrolling message has just ticked
              away and we're unmistakably nearing the 100th (and final) percent
              now.... In a few seconds, the scrolling message will start
              anew.... Au revoir auf wiedersehen tot ziens arrividerci tschuess
              good bye houdoe doeg see you later, alligator .....Anyway, we hope
              to see you again in the next TEX demo (if one should be made
              sometimes).

            <p>Bye!"</p>

            <h5>3.2.1.8 Digital Sound Samples</h5>
            <p>
              When you scroll to the very bottom of the music list on the main
              screen of the B.I.G.-Demo, there is a special entry called "The
              Digital Department." Selecting it changes the view, and suddenly
              the Atari ST's speakers produce digital samples of
              near-professional quality with adaptations of even more games. The
              music was close to the capabilities of the Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here The Exceptions announced another demo… called the
              Amiga-Sound-Demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              After they had adapted nearly all of Rob Hubbard's Commodore 64
              game music, it was now time to start adapting Hubbard's Commodore
              Amiga music. And who else would be capable if not The Exceptions?
            </p>

            <h5>
              3.2.1.9 The Elements of Design and the Aesthetics of Pixels of the
              B.I.G. Demo
            </h5>
            <p>
              The images produced for the B.I.G.-Demo looked like they belonged
              in a computer or video game, but they were not created for that.
              They were created to stand on their own, to be beheld in their own
              space, all the while in the context of other images produced on
              computers. They were images composed of clearly visible and
              sometimes even distracting building blocks: pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the low-resolution images of the time that were composed of
              pixels, the pixels themselves did not simply represent a part of
              the image that, together with the other pixels, forms a greater
              whole—the image as a complete artifact. Pixels were too big, too
              stark, too noticeable for that. Pixels also existed as independent
              entities known as "digital brush strokes," as clearly visible
              building blocks of the entire image. This gives each pixel a life
              of its own, an unapologetic presence, a value in and of itself, in
              addition to the part of the whole picture that it represents.
            </p>
            <p>
              This made the pixelated images of this era stand apart from
              paintings, photography, and film frames. Today's displays, with a
              greater resolution than the eye can discern, can take the shape of
              anything we throw at them. They can "pretend" to show photos or
              reproductions of paintings or videos. The pixelated images of the
              Atari ST and similar computers could not pretend to be anything
              else than what they were. They truly embrace their form.
            </p>

            <h5>3.2.1.10 The Making of the B.I.G.-Demo</h5>
            <p>
              Richard Karsmakers (Cronos), the editor of the diskmag "ST-NEWS"
              helped initiate the B.I.G.-Demo and wrote most of the
              record-breaking scrolling text. He had approached The Exceptions
              to motivate them to create the biggest and best demo so far. Five
              months later, they released it on January 24, 1988.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jochen Hippel manages to get the raw data of the original music
              from the Commodore 64 to the Atari ST using a data cable and a
              conversion program supplied by Udo Fischer and Erik Simon. This
              does not mean that the music was in any way playable or sounded
              good on the Atari ST. The further manual conversion work was
              time-consuming and required a lot of adaptations to the Atari ST's
              inferior sound chip.
            </p>
            <p>
              The programming of the many Psych-O-Screens requires exact timing
              and expert knowledge of the hardware. Together with the music,
              graphics, and digi-sound sample, all the data needed to be
              compressed to a single-sided 3.5" floppy disk so that The
              Exceptions could allow the demo to run on the largest possible
              range of Ataris.
            </p>
            <p>
              Richard Karsmakers continued collaborating with members of The
              Exceptions. They contributed articles, graphics, and music to
              "ST-NEWS". Karsmakers also wrote a first-hand account of how they
              finished their next demo, called the Amiga Demo.
            </p>

            <h4>3.2.2 Amiga Demo</h4>
            <p>
              The Amiga Demo directly targeted the superior sound capabilities
              of the Commodore Amiga by converting tunes that were regarded as
              impossible on the Atari ST's limited sound hardware. As if to
              conquer the last territory of the ST's inferiority compared to the
              Amiga, The Exceptions released the Amiga Demo as their last full
              demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Little Sound Demo and Little Color Demo, The Exceptions
              matched the sound generation capabilities of the Commodore 64's
              SID chip. Now, they conjured the same sound quality as the mighty
              Paula chip in the Commodore Amiga from the Atari ST's YM-chip.
              Paula could produce four channels of PCM sample-based digital
              sound. Technically, it was ahead of anything at the time, only to
              be matched on the IBM PC compatible with the introduction of the
              expensive Sound Blaster sound card and arguably by the sound
              capabilities of the Sega MegaDrive/Genesis when it was released in
              1988.
            </p>

            <p>
              Figure 47: The music demo screen of the Amiga Demo (screenshot)
            </p>

            <p>
              The Amiga Demo consists of two screens. The first screen is an
              imitation of a music program on the Commodore Amiga called Aegis
              Sonix. This piece of software was never written for the Atari ST.
              It takes advantage of the Amiga's sound capabilities and provides
              users with an environment to compose music using notation. The
              Exceptions did not port the actual program onto the ST; rather,
              they created a copy of the file selection screen and a part of the
              notational screen in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              They ported seven pieces of music from Amiga games, like "Rally
              Master", "Amegas", and "Crashin' Robb", for a total of fifteen
              minutes of high-quality, four-voice musical tunes, even though the
              Atari ST is only capable of playing three-voice music. Users can
              switch music by choosing a tune with the cursor keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              This digisound was impressive enough, given the ST's sound and
              music limitations, but the most impressive screen is accessed by
              pressing the "O" key (O for overscan). This opens up the overscan
              screen with no lower border and for the first time on the Atari ST
              no right border. Removing the right border and using the space for
              graphics was considered to be impossible. The Exceptions had done
              it.
            </p>
            <p>
              They filled the screen with a pulsating pattern reminiscent of
              Yayoi Kusama's colorful polka dot art. Along the lower half of the
              screen, a transparent text scrolled. The blue fractal patterns
              shine through the red text.

            <h5>3.2.2.1 The Making of the Amiga Demo</h5>
            <p>
              The Exceptions not only broke two new limits of the Atari ST by
              opening up the right border and playing Amiga-quality digimusic,
              but they also managed to break a personal record for the longest
              continuous time spent programming without interruption.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the demo-makers were visiting their friend Richard
              Karsmakers, the editor of the diskmag "ST-NEWS", they wrote the
              whole demo in one continuous hackathon. Karsmakers chronicled the
              creation of the Amiga Demo in ST-NEWS. They worked on the demo for
              22 hours straight, fighting against the hardware, using tricks to
              overcome limitations, and all the while eating pizza and drinking
              soft drinks until most everyone fell asleep. Udo Fischer (-ME-)
              was left to wrap up the programming. Karsmakers contributed the
              contents of the scrolling text. Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) managed to
              faithfully convert the Amiga music to the ST's hardware, and Erik
              Simon (ES) created the graphics and the transparent font they
              needed for the demo.

            <h4>3.2.3 Mainstream Exposure</h4>
            <p>
              In 1988, Tarik Ahmia, the editor-in-chief of the established
              mainstream computer magazine "ST-Magazin 68000er" published by
              Markt & Technik in Bavaria, reached out to Udo Fischer, Erik
              Simon, Michael Raasch, and Gunter Bitz. The Exceptions had become
              minor celebrities in the Atari ST demoscene, but they were not
              widely known to the computer-using audience. Tarik Ahmia convinced
              them to write a series of articles about their programming tricks.
              In five articles in 1988, The Exceptions revealed all of their
              programming secrets to a major audience and became widely known
              outside of the niche of the demoscene. In photos they were
              depicted as silhouettes, and they were marketed as secret insiders
              with only their first names used. This made them seem forbidden
              and taboo, like true hackers. Undoubtedly, it contributed to their
              allure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their series of articles was called "Die Hexer," German for "The
              Wizards."
            </p>

            <p>
              Figure 51: The Exceptions wrote about their programming tricks in
              the
            </p>
            <p>established mainstream computer magazine ST-Magazin 68000er</p>
            <p>and reached a wide audience</p>

            <p>
              Under Tarik Ahmia's leadership, the "ST-Magazin 68000er" not only
              covered computing news, reviewed games and applications, and
              provided type-in programs, but it offered several series examining
              how to produce creative work on the Atari ST. Aside from The
              Exceptions, the magazine featured series by commercial artists who
              produced their own magazines using desktop publishing software on
              the ST and others creating 3D animations for commercial TV
              stations in Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this thesis, the articles in "ST Magazin 68000er" are used as
              sources for the technical explanations of the achievements of the
              demos. An in-depth analysis would exceed the scope, but they
              warrant a short examination.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the late 1980s computers had become widespread tools in
              corporate administration. They were used for calculations,
              transactions, word processing and other business-related tasks.
              The use of computers as creative tools had been pioneered in the
              1960s and 70s, but only started to break into commercial design in
              the late 1980s. By the time The Exceptions were featured in "ST
              Magazin 68000er" the print industry around news media and
              publishing was in the process of transforming to digital
              production. The first Hollywood movies had started to feature
              computer animations. The tools used in the professional sector
              like Linotype page setting systems for page layouts in publishing
              and the Quantel Paintbox for infographics on TV were expensive and
              specialized. Home computer enthusiasts could identify that even
              though these systems were far more advanced than their own 16-bit
              computers, at their core the expensive machines were not that much
              different than the higher end home computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              By showcasing early hobbyist digital creatives like The
              Exceptions, computer magazines demonstrated the creative potential
              of the machines. They provided instructions on how home users
              could produce their own works and inspire them to produce images,
              music, animations and even demos. Users could recognize that the
              expensive professional computers were much more capable, but they
              could also see that compared to the expensive machines the gap
              between the capabilities of their own computers was closing. A
              Paintbox sold for $100,000 only half a decade earlier could
              display photorealistic images with 256 colors from a potential
              color palette of 16 million. Yet the artists used a graphics
              program on it that resembled the paint applications on the Atari
              ST, the Apple Macintosh and the Commodore Amiga. On an Atari ST
              for $1000, with a lot of effort home users could create their own
              graphics that came close to the professional graphics. They could
              see the potential lying dormant in the technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              By not only reporting on The Exceptions, but by providing them
              with the opportunity to write a series of articles, The Exceptions
              explained how to produce impressive results with the ST. Computer
              enthusiasts now saw the human beings behind the technology. They
              saw that The Exceptions were using the same tools available to
              home users. Even though it can be assumed that the editors of the
              magazine revised the articles provided by The Exceptions, there is
              still an endearing awkwardness in the text. Each article features
              a different member e.g. explaining how to program smooth scrolling
              routines; how to produce more colors on the screen; how to paint
              graphics; how to write music. The articles are full of enthusiasm
              and pride at the achievements, yet they are apologetic in their
              descriptions of the solutions because they emphasize that there
              might be better ways to achieve the same results. The articles
              were clearly written by young people who had figured out
              techniques and wrote about them in a language that resonated with
              young readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the mid-1980s only very few programmers were being promoted by
              name. They were not yet treated like authors of books or rockstars
              This was the time before John Carmack and John Romero who later
              became famous for the 3D-shooter "Doom". This was before Shiguro
              Miyamoto at Nintendo became famous. In the United States, there
              already were a small number of famous games developers like
              Richard Garriott (aka "Lord British") who had created the
              Ultima-Series of computer-role-playing-games, Roberta Williams who
              had written "King's Quest" and many other games at her company
              Sierra On-Line. Sid Meier created "Pirates" and had his name put
              on the box. In the UK, the Bitmap Brothers were being promoted by
              their publisher Mirrorsoft like rockstars using the full public
              relations power of Robert Maxwell's media empire.
            </p>
            <p>
              But they all seemed so far away, none of them were from a small
              town in Germany. It was a breakthrough for members of the
              demoscene to be featured in a print magazine.

              This was the year that The Exceptions peaked as demo-makers and
              produced the most demos. Their demos broke numerous hardware
              limitations, like the ST's color limits, the bottom and the right
              screen borders, and the limits of the ST's sound chip with their
              music conversions from other systems like the C64 and the Amiga.
              In the B.I.G-Demo, they produced the longest scrolling text to
              date.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also the year that The Exceptions started to collaborate
              with others in the demoscene. At first with Alyssa whose
              programming trick for the removal of the bottom border was used in
              the Super-Neo-Demo-Show. Then, in the B.I.G.-Demo, they
              collaborated with the diskmag ST-NEWS for advertising and
              distribution, as well as the diskmag's editor Richard Karsmakers
              for project management and scrolling text.
            </p>
            <p>
              This was the year that The Exceptions found recognition outside of
              their small scene by reaching a larger audience in the print
              publication "68000er ST-Magazin", explaining their programming
              tricks. But this was also the year that the main members of The
              Exceptions decided to become legitimate game programmers. They
              would no longer have time to create full demos. The move was
              necessary for them to make a living from their skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              And by 1988, The Exceptions had already inspired so many others in
              the Atari ST demoscene that they had passed the torch on to other
              demo-makers. However, in the next year, The Exceptions would still
              collaborate with others on their mega-demo: the biggest demo of
              all.
            </p>

            <h3>3.3 The Year 1989: Demo Coders Unite!</h3>
            <p>
              The year 1989 was the culmination of the Atari ST demoscene so
              far. What started out as a single-screen demo with a scrolling
              text, now evolved into barnstorming displays of animation,
              multilayered scrolling, color explosions, and 3D graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
              No single demo-maker or team was capable of delivering this
              breadth of effects, graphics, and music. It was the Union of
              multiple demo-groups, like The CareBears, Deltaforce, the TNT-Crew
              and—of course—The Exceptions, that came together to produce two of
              the best demos on the Atari ST in the year. The borders broke. The
              quest for true overscan was finally successful. The whole monitor
              area now became the playground for demos.

            <h4>3.3.1 Union Demo</h4>
            <p>
              January 1989 saw the culmination of the Atari ST demo efforts so
              far. The multiple demo-groups had joined forces to produce the
              Union demo. The Exceptions teamed up with the TNT Crew, the Care
              Bears, Level 16, the Replicants (a French cracker team), and the
              Delta Force.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Union Demo was the first true mega-demo that deserved its
              name. In it, all the limits of the Atari ST were broken. In nearly
              a megabyte of compressed features, each demo-group had their own
              section. Users moved a player character through a scrolling,
              building to select the different screens, acting as an interactive
              menu.
            </p>
            <p>
              Marco Breddin described the Union Demo as: "Here it is, the
              computer without custom chips, without sprites, without scrolling,
              without a synthesizer that was built using rather too few quality
              checks but filled with passion, the charm and energy of a young
              computer generation that will give their all to break the borders
              and don't care about system specifications."
            </p>
            <p>
              Six demo-groups worked on the mega-demo—The CareBears (TCB),
              TNT-Crew, Delta Force, the Replicants, Level 16, and The
              Exceptions, with eighteen contributors to create the thirteen
              screens of the Union Demo. The examination of each dazzling screen
              starts below.

            </p>

            <p>
              The startup screen appears when the demo loads. It features the
              Union logo and sliding distorted text that moves across a
              vertically scrolling backdrop. The text layout is distorted along
              a wobbly sine curve, with the screen using more than the ST's
              standard 16 colors with music playing in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              This demo screen was created by The CareBears. Programming was by
              Niclas Thissel (Nick/Nic) and Jas from The CareBears (TBC), with
              graphics by Erik Simon (ES). Sound and music conversion was by
              Jochen Hippel (Mad Max), and music composition by Jeroen Tel.

            </p>

            <p>
              This screen serves as the menu for the whole demo. It is a
              computer game where users control the character of Charly, an
              aardvark figure that moves across a paved surface that scrolls
              horizontally. The wall behind it has several doors—a door for each
              segment of the demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              The main area of the screen scrolls smoothly in all directions.
              Users move the character to a door, and then they can enter a
              different section of the demo. Beneath the interactive menu area,
              a smooth horizontal scrolling text moves across the full width of
              the screen using the left and right border. So together with the
              main area and the scrolling text, there are two independent
              scrolling areas. An alien landscape shines through the text,
              scrolling at a different speed than the letters. Of course, the
              screen features more than the standard 16 colors the ST can
              usually display at once.
            </p>
            <p>
              The screen was programmed by Gunter Bitz (6719) of The Exceptions,
              with graphics by Erik Simon (ES). The graphics for the character
              of Charly were drawn by Micky. The scrolling text was programmed
              and written by The CareBears. The left and right borders were
              removed by the TNT-Crew. Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) converted the
              music, which was composed by Jeroen Tel.

              This screen features a vertical background scrolling smoothly with
              a large horizontal text scrolling across the lower part.
              Effectively, this demo screen showed two large scrolling areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              The scroller at the bottom of the screen features parallax
              scrolling, where both the text and the hi-tech background move
              across the screen, but at different speeds. The graphic shows a
              field of explosions like the pattern of napalm bombing seen from
              afar. The CareBears have placed the painted words: TCB and "Beat
              'dis!" across the pattern of explosions and scrolled that
              vertically.
            </p>
            <p>
              All the while approximately, 450KB of digitized, high-quality
              music can be heard. The voice samples "Get down to the funky beat"
              are repeated to a techno beat. Users need an Atari ST with at
              least one megabyte to hear the music. The demo-makers knew that,
              in 1989, this was not yet a widespread configuration, so machines
              with less RAM would play chip music by Mad Max instead of the
              sampled sounds.
            </p>
            <p>
              This part of the demo was programmed by Niclas Thissel (Nick/Nic)
              and Jas with graphics by Erik Simon (ES). The font was created by
              Nic using the PC-Font-Maker. The sampled sound and music were
              provided by An Cool. Mad Max programmed the sound chip to play the
              music composed by Fred Gray.

            </p>

            <p>
              The spherical demo screen by Delta Force is split up into three
              main sections. The top segment shows the logo of Delta Force. It
              rhythmically flips to change to the logo of the Union and back
              again.
            </p>
            <p>
              The section in the center shows a three-dimensional textured plane
              with three bubbles floating above it. They pulsate to the music
              corresponding to the Atari ST's three sound channels. The bubbles
              cast shadows on the plane.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bottom part of the screen shows another scrolling text. This
              time, it is distorted along a sine curve as it horizontally flows
              across the screen. Each character's colors fluctuate in wave
              patterns. The text moves back and forth and occasionally flips
              vertically. It was clearly not only created to be read by the
              audience but also to impress with its transformations. The
              background music was converted from the Commodore 64 game, Mega
              Apocalypse.
            </p>
            <p>
              This screen was programmed by New Mode. The graphics were provided
              by Slime and Questlord from Delta Force. The graphics for the
              purple bubbles were created by Erik Simon (ES). The music was
              composed by Rob Hubbard and converted to be playable by the ST by
              Jochen Hippel (Mad Max).

            <p>
              This screen has some of the first 3D graphics in a demo. In front
              of a starfield in space, fast and solid models were spinning
              across the screen. First, the logo of the TNT-Crew, who had
              created this section of the demo, then a simplified version of the
              Union logo. The TNT-Crew had a 3D version of the famous Amiga
              ball, but their version had its center carved out. The final two
              models were a spaceship ripped from the game Starglider II and a
              carrier from Carrier Command. The presentation was accompanied by
              chip music. Users could switch between models by pressing the key
              0 to 5.
            </p>
            <p>
              This screen was programmed by Hexadez and Jojo from the TNT-Crew
              with sound and music by Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) from The
              Exceptions (TEX). Later, the developers from the TNT-Crew moved
              into game development.

            <p>
              The Atari ST has no hardware to support smooth scrolling, but the
              TNT-Crew wanted to prove that it was possible to program a smooth
              horizontal scroller (that was done before) in addition to
              programming four layers scrolling horizontally at independent
              speeds simply to outdo their peers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This screen features a slowly moving bubble pattern in the
              background. On top of that, a techno-organic layer scrolls across
              the screen. A green layer in unapologetically shrill colors speeds
              over the two background layers. To top it off, the scrolling text
              dashes over multiple planes. The four-layer scrolling is smooth at
              50 frames per second. To add a final touch, the screen features
              more than 100 colors and is accompanied by digitized music.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a user presses the arrow keys, the scrolling direction of the
              bubbly background layer changes. The smoothness and fluidity of
              the scrolling make this one of the more impressive screens of the
              whole demo.

              This screen was programmed by Michael Bittner (Hexogen) from the

              Starballs is probably the least impressive screen in the Union
              Demo. It shows a blue space with bubbles shooting towards the
              audience. The bubbles scale fluently for a fake perspective
              effect. The Union logo hovers transparently on top of the screen
              while a relatively small scrolling text moves across the bottom of
              the screen. Unfortunately, the Starballs screen does not break any
              new ground. The background music was inspired by David Lynch's
              movie, Dune.

              The Wobbly Sprites screen by the demo-group the Replicants shows
              two scrollers with an alpha effect. In the layer under the words
              "The Union" at the top and the bottom of the screen, just peeking
              in between the contours, two scrolling texts rush by. They can
              only be read if you really focus on them. Thirteen sprites forming
              the name of the demo-group dance along sine waves and wobble
              across the screen. Six raster color bars move up and down at
              different speeds.

              This screen was programmed by Excalibur with graphics by Rank
              Xerox, both part of the Replicants. The music was converted by

              The screen shows a scrolling text occupies most of the screen:
              Multicolored letters shoot across the screen. Meanwhile, the Union
              logo and The CareBears' brag wiggles up and down to the digitized
              industrial music featuring a sample of a lady moaning. The red
              background looks like cosmic worms or brain matter and scrolls

              This was the very first time that the Atari ST could be coerced
              into using the full display and remain stable while doing so.
              Level 16 perfected programming the electron beam to achieve this.
              The Atari ST's whole screen was now a stage for demos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The top of the screen shows an abstract landscape framed by what
              looks like brains. In the center, the sun is setting to a raster
              horizon with dozens of colors. The handles of the demo-makers are
              scattered across the golden plane.
            </p>
            <p>
              The centerpiece is the Level 16 logo. A pipe runs through it from
              the right side of the screen, where the ST usually shows a border,
              across and behind the logo to the left side. In an allusion to a
              simple Rube Goldberg machine, the pipe spews blue liquid into a
              funnel, exactly where the left border should be visible. The base
              of the logo sports a simplified cityscape with letters spelling
              out "Worldwide" beneath it.
            </p>
            <p>
              A pool of blue liquid with two splashes and the ever-present
              bubbles occupies the lower part of the screen. The whole screen is
              constantly traversed by a sprite in the shape of the Union's
              letter "U," moving into and out of areas that were previously
              reserved for the ST's screen borders, proving that this limit had
              now been broken.
            </p>
            <p>
              How did the demo-makers conquer the whole screen? The screen
              height is about 412 lines, and the Atari's hardware counts each
              scanline. It knows which line the monitor's beam is drawing at
              each moment. When the line has drawn the left border, the Atari ST
              starts to top draw the actual graphics; it stops drawing graphics
              at the right border. When the beam reaches bottom line of the
              screen, the ST stops drawing graphics.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Atari ST could work using the North American NTSC standard and
              the European PAL standard. On a US monitor, the ST would switch
              its display to 60 Hz to display 60 pictures per second with a
              slightly smaller main area; on a European monitor, the ST would
              display 50 pictures per second with a larger main area.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demo-makers at Level 16 realized that if they switched the
              computer from the European display frequency to the North American
              display frequency at just the right point, they could fool the
              hardware into continuing to draw into the border. This required
              very precise coordination of each instruction and knowing the
              exact position of the monitor's beam at any time so that the demo
              could switch frequency at the right point. To use the left border,
              the ST was forced to switch to the 71Hz frequency of the
              monochrome resolution for a split second to confuse the display
              hardware. This pulsating distortion of the machine's synapses
              allowed the ST to use the full screen. It became a carefully
              coordinated clockwork of colors and coordinates.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Atari ST was complex enough to be powerful, but still simple
              enough so a person could understand every aspect of its hardware
              so that they could hack it. And Level 16 hacked it to do exactly
              what they wanted.
            </p>
            <p>
              The screen was programmed by Ilja from Level 16 with graphics by
              Don from Level 16 and Erik Simon (ES) from The Exceptions. The
              music featured on this screen is an original composition by Mad
              Max.

            <p>
              While Level 16's fullscreen part of the Union Demo may technically
              be the most impressive section, the third scroller by The
              CareBears is not only technically impressive but also
              aesthetically spectacular.
            </p>
            <p>
              The CareBears created a multilayered scrolling screen. The top and
              bottom parts of the screen have about a dozen layers smoothly
              scrolling by at different speeds to create a parallax effect and a
              feeling of perspective depth. Like the warming inevitability of a
              summer's breeze, the multiple planes speed across the screen as
              smoothly, as fluently, as a lover's pounding heart.

            <p>
              In the center of the screen, The CareBears logo gets
              algorithmically distorted and mathematically flipped while
              pounding digi-techno plays. The fonts are metallic and heavy
              metal-inspired. They were, at the same time, cheap and glossy,
              inspired by computer games.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over and across the whole screen, a sine wave of text whips
              across, moving in and out of the top and bottom sections. And all
              of this with hundreds of colors on the screen at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
              This screen was programmed by Niclas Thissel (Nick/Nic), who also
              created the graphics. Like in all the other sections, Jochen
              Hippel (Mad Max) converted the music—this time composed by Rob
              Hubbard.

              The total size of all the data of all the screens of the Union
              Demo was 1400KB. The Exceptions helped find a way to compress all
              of this to 900KB. Udo Fischer (-ME-) programmed compression
              routines that unpacked the required parts of the demo when a user
              accessed one of the screens. The Union Demo came on a
              double-sided, 3.5" floppy disk that only fits 720KB. But The
              Exceptions came up with an extended disk format to fit the full
              900KB of crunched code, graphics, and music. For more details on
              disk formats and how to archive them, please see Appendix I.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, this meant that the disk could not be copied the
              regular way using the Atari ST's operating system. Therefore, The
              Exceptions devised a copying program as part of the demo itself.
              This copier enabled users to make as many copies of the Union Demo
              as they liked. It formatted the target disk to take advantage of
              the extended disk format. Naturally, The Exceptions added their
              own color effects to this screen while the copying process was
              running.
            </p>
            <p>
              The copier was programmed by Gunter Bitz (6719) and Jochen Hippel

              music composed by Jeroen Tel, and sound adaptation by Mad Max.

              The Union Demo has a hidden screen that can be accessed by moving
              the Charly character on the menu screen to one of the plants.
              Users are presented with the ST Soundtracker Sample-Mon, a music
              player that can reproduce the high-quality four-voice music from
              the Amiga on the ST's three-voice sound chip. When moving the
              mouse, the mouse pointer gets replaced by computer game-like
              sprites.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Soundtracker was programmed by Gunther Bitz (6719), with

            <h5>3.3.1.14 Breaking the Atari ST's Limitations</h5>
            <p>
              The Atari ST started out as the underdog of the 16-bit computer
              generation. It was affordable, but its hardware was rushed to
              market. This led to limitations on the number of colors on screen,
              big screen borders, no dedicated graphics chips for horizontal or
              vertical scrolling, no hardware support for sprites, and a sound
              chip that was used in 8-bit computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Union Demo broke all of these limitations. All the demo
              screens showcased dozens of colors and far surpassed the ST's
              standard 16 color limitation. The fullscreen section by Level 16
              removed all of the borders and used them to display graphics. The
              CareBears (TCB) and the TNT-Crew created super-smooth
              multidirectional scrollers—in some cases, multiple scrollers on
              the same screen moving horizontally and vertically. The Replicants
              had more than a dozen sprites whizzing around fluidly. And the
              limitations of the ST's AY/YM soundchip were blown away by Mad
              Max, who managed to tickle out of the archaic sound hardware music
              worthy of a Commodore Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
              As The CareBears (TCB) adequately put it in their Wow!
              Superscroller: "The Union needs no custom chips." Where the
              hardware left them wanting, the demo-makers made up for it in
              their ingenuity for programming the software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Stefan Posthuma, a demo-maker known as Digital Insanity from the
              demo-group The Lost Boys, wrote about the Union Demo in his
              "History of Demo Programming on the ST" in the diskmag ST-NEWS:
            </p>
            <p>
              "This was it. Everybody thought this to be the ultimate demo,
              something never to be equalled. Well, in a sense this is true.
              'The Union Demo' is a true classic, making a heavy impact on the
              demo world. 'The Union Demo' contained a few screens by The
              CareBears, including the 3D-sinus-and-a-whollottamore-stuff (or
              something) scroller which is considered by most people to be the
              best demo screen ever written. With their screens The CareBears
              established themselves once and forever and their coder Nic
              (Niclas Thissel) was to become a living legend afterwards."

            <p>
              The Exceptions might have pioneered the Atari ST demoscene, but to
              create the Union Demo, six disparate groups from all over Europe
              came together to create thirteen demo screens: Niclas Thissel
              (Nic), Jas, Micky, and An Cool from The CareBears (TCB), New Mode,
              Slime and Questlord from Delta Force, Hexadez, Jojo, and Hexogen
              (Michael Bittner) from the TNT-Crew, Excalibur and Rank Xerox from
              The Replicants, Ilja and Don from Level 16, Erik Simon (ES),
              Jochen Hippel (Mad Max), Gunter Bitz (6719), and Udo Fischer

              contributed to this technical masterpiece that surpassed all

              with ideas and innovation.

              The Union Demo was not only the swan song of The Exceptions as
              demo-makers; 1989 was the last year that The Exceptions spent any
              substantial amount of time on creating demo art.

            <p>
              They moved on to game development and founded Thalion together
              with other key players in the ST demo scene, like members of the
              TNT-Crew, The CareBears (TCB), and DeltaForce. They would spend
              the rest of 1989 working on their game releases. Meanwhile, other
              demo-groups from all over Europe saw what could be done with the
              Atari ST. The game was on.

              In 1989, The CareBears from Sweden released their impressive
              Swedish New Year Demo. And not to be outdone by their competition
              in the scene, they followed that with the Cuddly Demo and the

              Phalanx released their Overdrive Demo in 1989 with music that came
              close to surpassing the efforts of Mad Max.

              Thalion Software, the new home of The Exceptions in Gütersloh,
              Northrhine-Westphalia in West Germany, started to release games
              for the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga. Among their first
              releases were the beat-em'-up game Chambers of Shaolin, the space
              shooter Warp, the jump-and-run Seven Gates of Jamabala, the
              shoot-'em-up Leavin' Teramis, and the puzzle game Atomix. They
              were technically sophisticated games with intricate graphics,
              smooth scrolling, and superior sound and music. Most were met with
              rave reviews and sold well in the market.

              The crowning achievement of Thalion was the game that The
              Exceptions had started working on right after the B.I.G. Demo. It
              was a fantasy role-playing game called Dragonflight. They worked
              on it until they achieved the level of perfection they wanted; it
              was released in 1990. Dragonflight was based on an original story
              by Erik Simon, who also produced the graphics. Udo Fischer
              programmed the game, and Jochen Hippel composed the music. The
              ST-NEWS veteran Richard Karsmakers wrote the novella that came as
              part of the package. The game was well received and spawned two
              sequels.

              After Dragonflight, The Exceptions released their most technically
              impressive game: Wings of Death, a vertical scrolling shoot-'em-up
              game. Both in Wings of Death and in Dragonflight, we meet a red
              dragon similar to the one we saw in the README.PRG demo back in
              1987.

              It employed every trick of the trade to create a "bullet-hell"
              vertical scroller with fluid backgrounds, dozens of on-screen
              sprites and—of course—many more colors than the ST had any right
              to display, accompanied by a pounding synth soundtrack.

              The Exceptions had made it. Their dreams had come true, and they
              had evolved from the basement-coders creating colorful demos to
              inspirational figures in demo art. They united the demoscene to
              create something spectacular, to finally become hard-working
              professionals in the bludgeoning games industry of the 1990s.

            <h3>3.4 Conclusion: Limitations Fueling Creation</h3>
            <p>
              The Exceptions were not the best, but they were the first on the
              Atari ST. They laid the groundwork for the best to come. Together
              with their fellow demo-makers, they learned their trade on a
              marginal computer with limited hardware. With their
              inquisitiveness and ingenuity, they managed to tickle out the last
              bits of performance out of the Atari ST and create demos that
              broke the last technical limits. While doing so, they created demo
              art and contributed to spawning a thriving scene on that system.
            </p>
            <p>
              By provoking their competitors, leading the way, and showing what
              can be done, they united groups from different countries and
              backgrounds to produce collaborative demo art projects in a
              pre-web age. Then, they used their skills, discipline, and
              dedication to become game developers.
