                This section and the following are the center piece of the
                thesis. It provides a detailed analysis of the demos produced by
                The Exceptions and by other relevant demo-groups on the Atari ST
                in during the research period. The analysis will be based on
                hermeneutic interpretations of the demo art and its component
                images, music, and scrolling text from the perspective of what
                they depict, technical aspects, the tone, and the cultural
                perspective. As a means to evaluate the significance of demo art
                for media art history, the objective here is to learn about the
                limitations that the demo-makers managed to circumvent, the
                techniques they employed, and the messages they sent out to
                their audiences.
              </p>
              <p>
                The source for the demos examined is pouet.net, the historic
                demoscene archive introduced above. Where possible, the demos
                were screened on the original hardware, a modified Atari Mega
                STE. This machine was released five years after the Atari ST, so
                it is not 100% compatible. If a demo could not be run on the
                original hardware, it ran in the open-source Atari ST emulator
                Hatari on MacOS and on the FPGA retro computer MiST (see
                Appendix I on the conservation and preservation of demo art for
                further information on emulation).

                3.1 Contest of Champions: Analysis of the Demos
              </h3>
              <p>
                This analysis starts with the 1987 Atari ST demos. While the
                Atari 520ST was introduced in 1985, it was only released to a
                wider audience in 1986. The Atari Corporation first provided
                small programs demonstrating the capabilities of the Atari ST
                for use at the point-of-sale, but these were limited to image
                slideshows showcasing the advanced graphics without any software
                tricks. The very first demo produced by crackers and demo-makers
                was released in 1987 by The Exceptions. It was the
                inconspicuously named <em>README.PRG.</em> The demo-group
                released three more demos in 1987 after README.PRG:
                <em>The Little Sound Demo (LSD),</em>
                <em>the Little Color Demo (LCD),</em> and the
                <em>Super-Neo-Demo-Show.</em>

              <p>
                In March 1987, The Exceptions released the very first demo on
                the Atari ST, <strong>README.PRG.</strong> The file was barely
                80KB. Files named <em>README</em> usually contained instructions
                or supplementary information relevant to an application, so
                users would normally open this kind of file before using an
                application. The Exceptions did not provide a text file; they
                provided an executable program. When users ran it first in 1987,
                it baffled them.

              </p>

              <p>
                Compared to later demos, it was rather restricted in scope.
                README.PRG was a single-screen demo with scrolling text. Roughly
                80% of the screen was occupied by an image created by Erik Simon
                (ES), and along the lower fifth, a scrolling text ran across an
                animated background.
              </p>

              <h4>3.2.1 The Elements of Design of the Readme Demo</h4>
              <p>
                The static graphic shows a lush fantasy landscape. The image's
                central piece is a red dragon perched on the base of the picture
                with wings spread wide. Visible in the distance behind the
                dragon is a temple made of square gray stones with what looks
                like a statue of a serpent's head hanging above the portal.
                Behind the temple's golden dome, there are gnarly gray mountains
                with other dragons flying between them. The sky is cloudy, but a
                bright gradient of colors stretches from the clouds to the
                mountains.
              </p>
              <p>
                The red dragon's arms are resting on a box with the initials
                "TEX" inscribed on it; the dragon's tail is tenderly wrapped
                around it, somewhat obscuring the letters. The dragon tilts its
                head downwards and breaths fire onto a red-and-white sphere,
                clearly identifiable as the Amiga ball from the earliest demos
                on the competing machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first thing that Atari ST users notice on the colorful
                screen are the many colors, more than the 16 colors that Atari
                ST usually displays. The sky's gradient already shows more than
                three dozen colors, far surpassing the ST's color limit; the
                hues of the temple, the shades of the mountains, and the
                saturated green of the meadows that are interfused with rich
                blue streams of water. In the center stands the red dragon with
                its venomous crimson tones, ripping into the landscape with
                flames engulfing the symbol of Amiga's superiority. While the
                dragon might well be interpreted as the Atari ST, it could well
                be the demo-makers themselves.
              </p>

              <h4>3.2.2 The Scrolling Text</h4>
              <p>
                These are the full contents of the demo's scrolling text with
                all its charming errors (the original was in all caps; the quote
                is converted to mixed case to make it more readable):
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Hi there!!! Welcome to the first demo screen produced by the
                Exceptions (TEX)! Maybe you remember all those funny little
                programs called "demos" on the good old '64. Here's now the
                first one of it's kind on Jack's good new ST. Yes, we all know
                that these PRG's aren't good for nothing, except for two little
                things... you sit and wonder whats going on with your computer,
                and we're getting a lot of know-how.<br /><br />The Exceptions
                are: -ME- and ES<br /><br />
                All the code in our demo was written by -ME- (the king of
                interrupts!). Graphics, characterset, colors (many, many colors
                eh?) and text by ES. The music was "lended" from the game
                'Extensor'. Try the keys 1 - 5 (0 to escape demo)! We bet that
                you thought a softscrolling like this is impossible on a
                bitmap-machine like the st. But as you see… and it's even
                running on the VBL-IRQ! You don't know what the hell this means?
                Oh, no not again such a C-programmer! Long live 68000-assembly
                language!
                <br /><br />And now, what nobody wants to see: The greetings.<br /><br />
                Ok, hi to the few people we know: SSS, Softknight and Indy,
                although he doesn't like the ST... Oh yes: A very special hello
                to all the poor Amiga-owners who can't write assembly programs
                on their pretty lady (haw, haw, haw…)! To finance this program a
                little bit of advertising was necessary: 'listen all you people
                to the greatest blues-band on earth: The Dingsbums!!!! Motto: Es
                werd gegroovt un' werd gegröhlt un' mit em Bier de Hals geölt!
                Gigs everywhere round Germersheim!' Let's come to an end. Folks:
                excuse me if there are any 'bugs' in the text. I haven't solved
                enough Infocom-adventures yet. Bye for now. We're working on our
                second demo, the shape-out seems to be a little bit difficult.
                see you..."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                From the outset The Exceptions had already formulated a strong
                motivation to create demos: to prove that the cheaper computer,
                the Atari ST, was as capable as the pricier Commodore Amiga.
                From this perceived position of inferiority, the purpose of
                their demos was not only to look "cool" for the sake of it, but
                also to beat the competing 16-bit platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite its charming spelling mistakes and Germanized English
                phrasing, the scrolling text of README.PRG reads like a simple
                manifesto. The graphics artist ES (Erik Simon) praises their
                work, commemorates the achievement of his partner Udo Fischer
                (-ME-), who coded the demo, and sends out greetings to their
                friends. But most of all, The Exceptions showed that they
                achieved something that was thought impossible: displaying many
                more colors at the same time than the Atari ST was deemed
                capable of showing and a soft scrolling text across the bottom
                of the screen. The background of the text even scrolls at a
                slightly slower pace, creating a parallax scrolling effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of these effects were only possible by coding natively and
                directly on the processor in assembly language, the last
                human-readable, but still very cryptic, language before reaching
                actual machine code composed of ones and zeros. The disadvantage
                of assembly language is that it requires deep knowledge of the
                computer's inner workings and requires a greater proficiency
                than the so-called higher programming languages, like C, Pascal,
                and BASIC. The big advantage is the sheer speed of execution of
                programs written in assembly language. A good assembler
                programmer is also not limited by any of the formalities and
                requirements that higher programming languages or the operating
                system impose; if an assembler coder manages to find a way to
                coerce the hardware into doing something, then it will work. The
                central processing unit (CPU) or processor of the Atari ST was
                the Motorola 68000. The same processor also beats at the heart
                of the Commodore Amiga, the original Apple Macintosh, and the
                Sega MegaDrive/Genesis.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their scrolling text, The Exceptions go on to mock anyone who
                cannot write 68000 assembly language, knowing full well that it
                is a daunting endeavor. Using a double entendre, ES calls anyone
                who does not know what VBL-IRQ means a C programmer. This might
                well be a programmer who writes code in the programming language
                C, or a class c (third-class) programmer.
              </p>
              <p>
                They go on to ridicule owners of the Commodore Amiga, but there
                seems to be a nod to the superiority of the Amiga. They call the
                machine a "pretty lady" and then exclaim a taunting onomatopoeic
                laugh, which can be read as a sexist, derogatory remark. It is
                also a play upon the Spanish meaning of the word "amiga" as
                girlfriend.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a latter section of the scrolling text, the writer alludes to
                advertising being necessary to finance the demo; this is quite
                likely tomfoolery. Both Erik Simon (ES) and Udo Fischer (-ME-)
                were fans of a band local to the town of Germersheim in the West
                German province of Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz). They
                go on to recount the motto of the band in German, which
                translates to:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "We groove, we shout, and we oil our throats with beer."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The text does have the occasional spelling mistake, but English
                was not the writer's first language. The punctuation is an
                interesting mix between German and French. Some of the opening
                quotes were the lower variety („...”) commonly used in German,
                while other quotes were a slightly wrong variation of the quotes
                used in French («...»), but as &laquo;...&raquo;. This does not
                mean much, except that the text was not proofread for mistakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the very end, the writer even apologizes for mistakes in the
                text, calling them bugs, and continues that he had not yet
                <em>"solved enough Infocom-adventures."</em> Infocom was a
                US-based software company known in the late 1970s through the
                late 1980s for their well-written text adventures, e.g.,
                <em>Zork, the Great Underground Empire,</em> or
                <em>The Leather Goddesses of Phobos.</em> These were a type of
                text-based interactive fiction where the player reads a

                These text adventures were only available in English, and they
                have not been localized to this day because merely translating
                the descriptions would be insufficient. It would instead be
                required to adapt the text parser, the part of the application
                that interprets the commands, to a language other than English.
                However, English had its advantage, as players who were not
                fluent in English would learn a lot of the language by playing
                text adventures. They would expand their vocabulary and learn
                how to express themselves in a way that the English-language
                text parser would understand.

              <h4>3.2.3 Technical Limitations Broken in README.PRG</h4>
              <p>
                The README demo broke several the Atari ST's technical
                limitations. At this point in time, The Exceptions only
                consisted of Udo Fischer (-ME-) and Erik Simon (ES), so they
                focused on graphics and scrolling. The Atari ST did not have any
                dedicated scrolling hardware capabilities, so programming smooth
                scrolling was up to smart programmers. The computer had a vast
                palette of 512 colors but was straddled with the 16
                color-limitation.<sup

                The Exceptions managed to produce:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  92 colors on the screen at the same time (from the overall
                  palette of 512 available colors)
                </li>
                <li>Smooth horizontal scrolling at 50Hz</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                How did The Exceptions manage to get that many colors on the
                screen at the same time? They used a technique called "raster
                interrupts." As the name suggests, this technique combines the
                "raster" method of drawing a screen image on a cathode ray tube
                monitor or television with the ability to "interrupt" a
                processor's work to produce small changes and immediately return
                to the original task.
              </p>
              <p>
                An "interrupt" is a signal from a computer's component sent to
                the main processor (CPU) to halt any operation in progress and
                jump to a specific routine in memory to do something else. After
                completing the task in the routine, the CPU resumes at exactly
                the point it was interrupted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term "raster" is used to describe the scanlines on a
                computer screen (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-20">figure 20</a>). A computer
                creates the screen image on the monitor line by line by feeding
                information to the electron beam that travels across the monitor
                or TV screen. This happened 50 times a second on the European
                screens and 60 times a second on US and North American screens
                due to the different electrical frequencies used in the regions.

                The Atari ST had three resolutions. The high and medium
                resolutions were conceived for business applications such as
                word processors, spreadsheets, databases, and desktop
                publishing, while the low resolution was the one The Exceptions
                used for their demos (and was used for most Atari games of the
                day).
              </p>
              <p>
                The low-res screen was 320 pixels wide and 200 pixels high. This
                area is a large part of the screen, but it does not occupy all
                of the screen because, in the 1980s and early 1990s, computer
                screens had a border around the main image. The smaller image
                area allowed the Atari ST to work with different TV standards
                (the PAL standard in Europe with a slightly larger available
                area but a lower frequency of 50Hz, and the NTSC standard in
                North America, with a small area but a higher screen refresh
                rate of 60Hz). The borders also keep the main image in the
                center of the screen, away from the curvature of the TV/monitor
                tube where it would suffer from less distortion (which was much
                greater towards the edges). Effectively, it means that around
                75% of the screen area was actually available to use (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-21">figure 21</a>).

              <h4>3.2.4 Adapting the Scanline</h4>
              <p>
                A "raster interrupt" is an interrupt that is deliberately
                triggered when the electron beam that draws the raster of
                scanlines is at a certain scanline on the screen. The interrupt
                sends the processor to a routine that produces a change in the
                way the scanline is drawn, e.g., change the border color or the
                complete palette before the processor proceeds to the next
                scanline (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-22">figure 22</a>). When the
                change induced by the interrupt has been registered, the
                processor resumes its previous task under the new conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this case, the next scanline is drawn with a changed set of
                colors. This happens so quickly that the user does not notice
                any delay but is presented with much more colorful graphics than
                they thought possible. Unfortunately, the more interrupts a
                processor must handle, the less time it can spend on other
                tasks; if the processor must switch color palettes at every
                scanline, it will suffer a slight loss of performance. Precise
                timing is necessary to achieve the desired effects; the switch
                between two palettes must be completely free of flickering and
                distortions to look appealing and free of errors.

                In the README demo, the ST's palette switches multiple times on
                the main screen. The top section switches parts of the palette
                half a dozen times to accommodate the colorful gradient of the
                sky (only the colors necessary for the clouds and the mountains
                remained constant across most of the sky's palettes). Once the
                sky section no longer needs to be accounted for, the palettes
                only switch a few times until half of the screen has been drawn.

                The bottom half of the image actually has a single 16-color
                palette of greens, blues, and reds. The bottom quarter is
                occupied by the scrolling text, which consists of gold text on a
                purple background, which looks like it is scrolling in the
                opposite direction of the text. This section has a separate
                16-color palette composed of yellow tones for the gold of the
                text, and purple shades for the background. Only 14 colors are
                visible in this bottom section because two color registers are
                reserved for the transparency of the letters.

              <h4>3.2.5 Silky Smooth Scrolling</h4>
              <p>
                The origins of the word "scrolling" might already be forgotten,
                but it means "screen rolling." Essentially, the computer is
                moving the contents of the screen in any direction. On the Atari
                ST, it makes no difference if the screen contains graphics or
                characters; for example, when you list a text file on the
                screen, the text scrolls up. More complex scrolling is common in
                arcades and video games, called "soft scrolling", where the
                graphics scroll smoothly across the screen without stuttering or
                jerking.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast to other computers of its generation (and even
                previous ones), the Atari ST had special chips or hardware to
                help with scrolling that had to be done with the ST's processor.
                To achieve this level of smoothness, there are several elements
                to be considered. The range of movement should not be too large,
                and the screen should refresh at 1/50th of a second, displaying
                the next phase of the scrolled contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions had a hard time figuring out how to produce
                smooth horizontal scrolling on the Atari ST. They found that
                vertical scrolling was easy, but they wanted to use it for their
                scrolling text where the letters travel from the right to the
                left so that the viewer can read them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason for the ST's difficulty with horizontal scrolling is
                the way it creates graphics. A bitmap image is composed of
                sequences of words (two bytes) in memory which contain 16 pixels
                of image information. If you want to shift the whole screen
                image or a part of it by one pixel up or down, it is sufficient
                to move the block of memory by a word, and the CPU can do this
                very quickly and smoothly. If you want to shift the screen
                horizontally, from right to left (or the other way), then the
                increment of a full word (two bytes or 16 pixels) is too large.
                Shifting the screen by less than a word means the actual bit
                content of each word must be moved. The 68000 CPU can handle
                about 32 lines, but anything beyond that would require its full
                focus, leaving no performance capacity for other operations,
                like music or setting up any other contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions needed to avoid any scrolling operations that ran
                on a bit-level. Shifting a full word at a time was not smooth
                enough because that shifts the screen by 16-pixel increments and
                causes a stutter. Therefore, Udo Fischer developed a technique
                that used eight buffers, and the screen graphics were stored
                pre-shifted in two-pixel increments in each of these buffers.
                When the Atari ST needed to display the next step of a scrolling
                image, it retrieved the pre-shifted graphics from the next
                buffer. When seven buffers with the pre-shifted images were
                displayed, the processor shifted the original graphic by a full
                word of 16 pixels and displayed this next. To save time needed
                to copy the buffer contents to the screen, The Exceptions used
                eight virtual screens in memory and shifted the address of the
                graphics memory from one buffer to the next. The primary
                disadvantage of this method was that it was extremely memory
                intensive. At 32KB per screen buffer, this meant that the ST had
                to occupy 256KB in total for all eight buffers to achieve smooth
                scrolling.

                When The Exceptions created their README.PRG demo, the only
                members were Udo Fischer and Erik Simon. They had programming
                and graphics covered, but they did not have a musician. For
                their first demo's music, they simply used the tune from the
                game <em>Extensor,</em> which sounded great and did a good job
                of using the mediocre sound chip of the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions released their second demo a few months after
                README, and it focused on music. In the
                <strong>Little Sound Demo,</strong> the newest member of The
                Exceptions, Mad Max Jochen Hippel, was the true star. He had
                faithfully converted tunes from the Commodore 64 to the Atari
                ST. Though from a previous computer generation, the C64's SID
                chip was superior to the ST's YM-chip, and Mad Max meticulously
                converted a total of 16 minutes of music from games on the
                Commodore 64 that famed composer and chip musician Rob Hubbard
                wrote for <em>International Karate,</em>
                <em>Monty on the Run,</em> <em>Commando,</em> and
                <em>Flash Gordon.</em> Mad Max composed four more tunes for the
                Atari's YM/AY chip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rob Hubbard was a commercial music composer for video games, and
                at the time, was still actively writing music for 8-bit systems.
                His music was particularly popular on the Commodore 64, where he
                managed to write some of the most exciting game music that often
                exceeded the game in quality. In many cases, users would
                purchase games specifically because the game music was written

                He was well-known in the niche circle of gamers in the 1980s,
                and in 2016, Hubbard received an honorary doctorate from Abertay
                University for his gaming music.<sup

                In 2019, Hubbard performed his 8-bit music rearranged for a full
                classical orchestra in Hull.<sup

                But in 1987, writing music that was as good as Hubbard's was the
                Holy Grail in the demoscene, and the Little Sound Demo,
                naughtily abbreviated as LSD, lived up to this promise.

                The demo still only featured one screen and a scrolling text.
                The top half showed a cartoon depiction of the Atari ST with
                eyes and a mouth spitting a music note on a Commodore 64 that
                itself had a look of bemusement, sticking out its cartoon tongue
                when hit by the note. The right showed the logo of The
                Exceptions and the name of the demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The graphics were not the demo's strong suit; rather, it was the
                sound. Users could hit the keys A to L on their Atari's keyboard
                and listen to faithful conversions from game music composed by
                Rob Hubbard and four original pieces by Mad Max. The music
                conversion was reasonably faithful, given the SID-chip's
                superiority over the ST's limited YM-chip. This was Mad Max's
                first attempt, and his efforts would improve in later demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scrolling text was again full of bragging, but with no
                greetings to other demo teams. Here is the full text, again
                changed to mixed case for better readability.

                The Exceptions were full of praise for their newest member. The
                team had found its musician, and they were ready to produce the
                next demo with even more music.
              </p>

              <h4>3.3.1 The Elements of Design of the Little Sound Demo</h4>
              <p>
                The intention of the graphic is clear: the Atari ST acts
                defiantly towards the Commodore 64. The execution, however, is
                anything but clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you know what the computers look like, you will probably
                recognize them in their pixel-painted and curved depictions in
                the graphic. The musical note spewed from the ST to the C64 is
                also still clearly recognizable. Identifying the white cartoon
                lines that form the Atari ST's and Commodore 64's "eyes" and
                "mouth" is much more difficult. The disparity in style between
                those elements based on simplistic white lines and full-colored,
                detailed rendering of the computers make a visual connection
                difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the scene is caged in a gray gradient tube frame that
                restricts the contents and serves no discernible purpose. This
                demo's focus is most definitely on the sound and music and not
                on the graphical aspects.

              <h4>3.3.2 Meeting Mad Max</h4>
              <p>
                Udo Fischer and Erik Simon had met Jochen Hippel in a computer
                shop in Mannheim, Rhineland-Palatinate. The shop was a meeting
                place, and ironically, customers met each other there to pirate
                games instead of purchasing the software available. They crossed
                paths again and again in ST user clubs in the towns of Ramsen
                and Bad Dürkheim.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time, Jochen Hippel was 15 years old. Despite his young
                age, he had already programmed music routines on the Commodore
                64 that sounded very much like the music of Rob Hubbard. At
                school, Jochen Hippel attracted attention because he had created
                rock versions of Christmas songs in computer class. Jochen did
                not own an Atari ST yet but was interested in the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                As soon as Hippel received his own Atari ST, the two members of
                The Exceptions pleaded him to join them and create music for
                their demos (and later-on, commercial games). He simply said,
                "Why not?" and joined them. The team had found their music
                specialist in Mad Max.
              </p>

              <h4>3.3.3 Converting SID to YM</h4>
              <p>
                To convert the original Hubbard tunes from the C64's SID was
                particularly challenging. There was no music notation of the
                songs, but the programming code could be pulled from the games.
                Mad Max could look at the original composition in hexadecimal
                code, but then had to calculate the new code for the Atari ST
                and meticulously convert each note to the capabilities of the
                more limited sound chip (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-25">figure 25</a>).<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-origin-03-46"

                  ></sup
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This conversion process ended up being very time consuming, so
                in the Little Sound Demo, the only complete pieces were from
                <em>International Karate,</em> the main theme from
                <em>Commando</em> and <em>Flash Gordon.</em> One of the original
                pieces by Mad Max was inspired by the <em>Marche Funebre</em> by
                Frederic Chopin.

                The <strong>Little Color Demo</strong> was the third demo by The
                Exceptions in 1987. According to their scrolling text, they
                completed it at the end of May, and it featured even more music
                that Mad Max had converted from games on the Commodore 64.
                Beyond that, the LCD had two scrolling messages: one vertical
                message and what appeared to be the tried-and-tested horizontal
                scrolling text of the previous demos, but with even more colors
                on screen beyond the machine's capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                To commemorate Rob Hubbard, Erik drew a small graphic of the
                musician saying, "Wow!" because the tunes were even more
                faithful conversions of the original SID music. The vertical
                scrolling text had a barrel distortion effect. The screen looked
                like it extended beyond the borders, which in fact, was only a
                fake "No-Border-effect" because the graphics did not really
                protrude into the border area. Rather, the border color was
                changed in the lower part of the screen to match the screen
                content, only creating the impression of no borders. From a
                historic perspective, this was the first demo to feature a
                "reset screen": a screen that could only be accessed by pressing
                the reset button on the side of the Atari ST. It was a testament
                to the programming capabilities of The Exceptions that they
                could even intercept signals sent to the hardware reset button
                of the computer and deviate from it (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-27">figure 27</a>).

                The scrolling text of this demo teased that it looked the same
                as in the previous demos and thus was "boring." But then, it
                suddenly transformed into a multitude of colors, and users could
                press the keys A to H to select the music. The real-time
                equalizer in the screen's center showed the real operating
                capacity of each of the YM-chip's three voices. To show off even
                more effects, The Exceptions had added two rotating 3D Atari
                symbols to the left and right of the equalizer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vertical scroller at the top only had a short text and
                featured greetings (something lacking in the previous Little
                Sound Demo). The full text of the vertical scroller was quite
                short:

                The horizontal scrolling text erupted in technicolor grandeur,

                The contents of the horizontal scrolling text lambast the ST's
                sound chip at the same time, lauding the valiant musical efforts
                of Mad Max. It ends with the announcement that The Exceptions
                will now give other demo-makers a chance to produce superior

                and our third demo is nearly ready. Mad Max falls asleep soon,

                According to their scrolling text, The Exceptions were going to
                take a break and challenge other demo-makers to produce their
                own demos. This turned out to be a wrong assumption, as they
                ended up contributing to another demo in September of 1987.

              <h4>3.4.1 The Elements of Design of the Little Color Demo</h4>
              <p>
                The graphics in the Little Color Demo are simpler and less
                playful than in the previous demo. The screen is crowded with
                little sense of distribution of the design elements, making it
                look like the artist panicked that any space left unused might
                be held against him. The elegance and use of colors from the
                first demo's dragon image are no longer found; instead it was
                replaced by generated effects, like the vertical scroller and
                the equalizer as centerpieces, yet drowned out by the odd
                repetition of the Rob Hubbard portrait image and Atari's
                spinning Fuji logo in front of the barely-recognizable TEX logo.

                Yet, this is all contrasted by the horizontal scrolling text
                below with its multicolored magnificence, radiating down each of
                the letters and making them resemble eccentric chameleons as if
                they have only ever seen Kandinsky's color studies through
                Vaseline-smeared lenses.

              <h4>3.4.2 Atari ST and Music Production</h4>
              <p>
                There are a few potential misconceptions about the Atari ST and
                its music capabilities that should be addressed at this point.
                The ST was popular and used frequently in the music industry.
                Musicians like Depeche Mode, Jean-Michel Jarre, and the Pet Shop
                Boys used the Atari ST in their studios.<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-origin-03-47"
                    href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-footnote-03-47"
                    >[47]</a
                  ></sup
                >
                It is important to note that they used the computer to enter
                their music compositions into a sequencer application. The Atari
                ST was attached to professional music synthesizers via its
                integrated Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) ports and
                provided instructions to the synthesizers to play the music
                sequences. The ST was the only computer of its time to come with
                MIDI ports by default.
              </p>
              <p>
                By comparison, the actual sound chip that the computer used to
                generate music and in-game effects was merely pedestrian. Users
                at the time were surprised that a modern computer like the ST
                had such a dated sound chip in the YM-2149F. Mad Max famously
                said about the YM-chip: "Atari built in a totally outmoded sound
                chip into the most modern computer." The Commodore Amiga had far
                better sound hardware, and even the Commodore 64 had a superior
                sound chip.
              </p>
              <p>
                This ambivalence led to the contradictory situation where the
                Atari ST had become the computer for professional musicians
                because it could control instruments, while game developers,
                chip musicians, and demo-makers had a hard time generating music
                from the internal sound chip.

                The Exceptions wanted to become legitimate game developers.
                While talented, they were also young and inexperienced, and
                therefore needed to find the right project and the right game
                publisher. This also meant that they would not have the time to
                work on any more demos in 1987… or so they thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                A friend in Mannheim working under the pseudonym Alyssa
                discovered how to display graphics in the lower border of the
                ST's screen.<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-origin-03-48"

                  ></sup
                >
                This intrigued the Exceptions; they wanted to try this in
                practice. Udo Fischer (-ME-) managed to display complete images
                created by Erik Simon and other artists, and then he utilized
                the lower border for the scrolling text. No more small images
                due to the space requirements of the scrolling text! He even
                managed to add rasters for more colors and to play Mad Max's
                music with digital sound effects.

              <p>
                To call this a demo might be a bit of an exaggeration because it
                is actually a slideshow of six images. The images were
                predominantly fantasy-themed pixel art produced by Erik Simon
                and his friends. K. Miller pixel-painted an ST version of Smaug
                from J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Hobbit,</em> based on the original
                painting by the painting brothers Hildebrandt (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-28">figures 28</a> and
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-29">29</a>). ES painted the
                movie poster of the animated feature
                <em>The Last Unicorn</em> and painter Rowena Morrill's cover for
                Piers Anthony's fantasy novel <em>Vision of Tarot.</em> The
                other images are King Tut (a mainstay of 16-bit graphics due to
                the reflections on the death mask), and a Porsche Turbo Carrera
                (see <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-30">figure 30</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The pictures were predominantly drawn by hand using the classic
                ST paint application <em>NEOchrome.</em> The whole demo screen
                makes use of more than 16 colors; the images themselves were
                pixel-painted within the ST's limitations of 16 colors, proving
                that the right artist can produce great results even within
                these limitations. The paint application NEOChrome's name is
                referenced in the name of the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.

                The extraordinary feature of this demo is the premiere on the
                Atari ST. For the first time, the demo-makers managed to remove
                the lower border; the scrolling text occupies a part of the
                lower border, and Erik Simon designed a new font for it. The
                lower part of the border is emblazoned with the TEX logo
                surrounded by little propellers spinning animatedly, proving
                that there really are graphics in the border.

              <h4>3.5.1 From Sketchpad via MacPaint to NEOChrome</h4>
              <p>
                Erik "ES" Simon preferred the paint application NEOChrome. It
                was the paint application included with Atari ST's when the
                computer was first released. The application can be compared to
                a color version of <em>MacPaint</em> that was released a year
                prior on the Apple Macintosh and shares many of the same user
                interface elements and tools (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-33">figure 33</a>). Except for
                the ST's use of color, the big difference is that in NEOChrome,
                the tools were not aligned on the side of the screen. They
                occupied the half the screen together with the color palette and
                zoom function that was always active (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-32">figure 32</a>).

              <p>
                NEOChrome's great advantage was its simplicity. It had the main
                paint tools and some limited animation capabilities, but it kept
                Erik Simon focused on the process of painting instead of being
                distracted by too many functions or by the complexity of the
                tool.

                Both MacPaint and NEOChrome can trace their origin back to
                SketchPad developed by Ivan Sutherland in 1962, which was the
                first painting and drawing program ever developed (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-34">figure 34</a>). In "Virtual
                Art: From Illusion to Immersion" pioneer of new media art

                prerequisite for interaction with virtual realities. Sketchpad
                was the precursor of graphics programs such as Adobe Illustrator
                or MacDraw, which replaced the abstract word-commands, that is,
                syntax, interface with the interface of pointing at icons with a
                device, that is, physical action, which was also much easier to
                use."<sup

                Using a mouse instead of a lightpen, but tracing its heritage
                directly to Sketchpad, the intuitiveness of NEOChrome enabled
                Erik Simon and The Exceptions to create the artwork necessary
                for this completely unexpected demo, the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.

              <h4>
                3.5.2 Technical Limitations Broken in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show
              </h4>
              <p>
                The greatest achievement of this demo was the premiere of
                graphics in the lower border of the ST's screen. Alyssa opened
                the lower border at the end of the normal screen area on line
                199 by briefly switching the screen frequency from 50Hz
                (European standard) to 60Hz (North American standard), and then
                switching back to 50Hz. The ST's Shifter chip handles the
                graphics, then displays an additional 47 scanlines of graphics.
                In this way, the Super-Neo-Demo-Show had an effective screen
                resolution of 320 x 246 pixels, exceeding the limits provided by
                Atari.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finding a way to open up the bottom border was the first
                elementary step that would later lead to conquering all the
                other screen borders. This gave them the first idea of a method
                to achieve what was thought to be impossible on the Atari ST:
                using the full screen without any borders, called overscan. The
                Commodore Amiga is capable of using the full overscan area out
                of the box.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Alyssa discovered this trick, he demonstrated it in an
                intro but did not release it to the public. He revealed the
                technique to Udo Fisher (-ME-) of The Exceptions, who used it in
                the Super-Neo-Demo-Show. The Atari ST demoscene wracked their
                brains about how this could have been achieved, and the
                Exceptions disclosed the secret in their B.I.G.-Demo in 1988
                (described below). Interested demo-makers had to sit through the
                longest scrolling text up to that point because the sync switch
                technique was only revealed at the very end of the text.

                Even after their first year of demos, The Exceptions still
                cracked games and distributed them. Game publisher Novagen's
                <em>Backlash</em> was one of them. While the game itself is a
                commendable first effort at producing a cut-down clone of Sega's
                arcade smash-hit <em>Space Harrier,</em> the interesting part
                was not in the game itself. The Exceptions had produced the
                <strong>Backlash Cracktro</strong> for the game, an intro for
                the cracked version.
              </p>

              <p class="text-secondary text-center">
                Figure 35: Left, the cracktro screen of <em>Backlash</em> with
                the first "synclock" rasters across the top and bottom border.
                Right, the adapted in-game credits.
              </p>

              <p>
                In their cracktro, they had the already-established mix of
                snappy music by Mad Max and a variant of their logo resplendent
                across the screen. This was the first time that the top and the
                lower border were used in a demo or intro in a stable way. This
                technique is called "synclock" rasters. While they did not put
                any graphics in the borders, The Exceptions used sophisticated
                palette switching (rasters) across the top and bottom border to
                show a kaleidoscope spread across the whole width (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-35">figure 35</a>). The main
                display area also made "synclocks," the rasters on the left and
                right create the impression of spreading the background into the
                borders. The technique is particularly difficult because it
                requires in-depth knowledge of the ST's hardware and ample
                experimentation to synchronize (sync) the program code in lock
                with the electron beam of the display.
              </p>

              <h4>3.6.1 The Elements of Design of the Backlash Intro</h4>
              <p>
                The compositions of the Backlash Cracktro is undoubtedly
                crowded. There was no weighting applied to its elements, and no
                apparent thought put into its use of space. The Exceptions' logo
                is rendered in a sparkling golden aesthetic that signals "bling"
                and the impression of having spared no costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <em>Backlash</em> logo was not created by Erik Simon but
                taken from the game itself. It nevertheless matches the other
                imagery with garish and unbalanced colors. That being said, the
                image bursts with unbridled energy and enthusiasm; it never
                claimed to aspire to be balanced, to unapologetically throw
                color and form at its audiences.
              </p>

              <h4>3.6.2 New Demo-Groups on the Atari ST</h4>
              <p>
                Other cracker groups began producing demos inspired not only by
                The Exceptions, but other factors as well. Demo-making was a
                phenomenon that spanned across all computer systems, but The
                Exceptions were one of the major motivating factors on the Atari
                ST. Other demo-makers started to match the colors, graphics,
                music, and sound effects of The Exceptions' first few demos, but
                they also set out to deliver on the next challenge: using the
                top border of the screen. Another team, the TNT-Crew around
                Michael Bittner (Hexagon), came very close to be the first to do
                so. Level 16 and the TNT-Crew were already independently working
                on "synclock" rasters when The Exceptions beat them to it with
                their cracktro to <em>Backlash.</em> Despite this, there was
                still much room for improvement. No one had yet put graphics
                into the top border.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two years later in 1989, the three teams joined forces to become
                part of the Union, a conglomerate of demo-groups.

              <h3 class="mt-5">3.7 Conclusion: The Achievements in 1987</h3>
              <p>
                In the first year of real ST demos, The Exceptions started out
                as a cracking group with a few intro screens in front of their
                cracked games. Then, they released their first demo that broke
                the Atari ST's color limitation. Admittedly, they were not the
                first to do so, as the art application NEOchrome from the Atari
                Corporation had managed to display 222 colors, 208 of which were
                in the color picker. However, The Exceptions were the first to
                produce artwork in more than 16 colors. They also combatted the
                prejudice that the Atari ST was not capable of smooth horizontal
                scrolling by producing horizontal scrolling text.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their first demo, The Exceptions established their rivalry
                with the Commodore Amiga, the technically superior and, at the
                time, far more expensive machine. They aspired to match the
                technical and artistic feats on the computer of their choice. On
                the one hand, this was out of a feeling of having chosen the
                possibly inferior machine; on the other hand, it was playful
                banter and living up to the challenge of achieving some of the
                same Amiga demo effects on the ST that should by not have been
                as capable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their next two demos, they addressed the limitations of the
                ST's sound hardware by producing music that was comparable to
                the superior SID chip in the Commodore 64. In all of their
                demos, they reached out to a virtual community of crackers and
                demo-makers, handing out kudos and greetings, yet still
                provoking their peers to produce their own works.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the year ended, The Exceptions found their first
                collaboration in a demo. Together with fellow demo-coder Alyssa,
                they took the first step in breaching the limitations of the
                screen borders by removing the lower border of the ST's screen.
                Again, this was not only thought impossible, but also something
                that only the Commodore Amiga could achieve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their demos' graphics and effects were influenced by fantasy and
                science fiction, the aesthetic borrowed from computer games.
                They taught themselves the necessary skills to produce their
                work. Erik Simon (ES) learned to pixel-paint without much to
                reference, except for the finished works of others. Udo Fischer
                (-ME-) taught himself to write Motorola 68000 assembly code, and
                at first not even on a machine with that processor but using a
                simulator on the 8-bit Commodore 64. Jochen Hippel (Mad Max)
                mastered music-making by copying his idol Rob Hubbard and
                converting his favorite game music to the less capable sound
                chip of the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                The language in the scrolling texts of The Exceptions was a
                combination of self-aggrandization with some jabs at their
                peers, yet oddly self-deprecating about their work. It sounded
                like they knew how good their skills were, but that the results
                they delivered always fell somewhat short of their own
                aspirations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1987, no other full demos were produced on the Atari ST.
                Peers of The Exceptions still released their work as intro
                screens to cracked games, though other demo-groups like Level 16
                and the TNT-Crew mobilized on the ST. It would take until 1988
                for other demo-groups to match the work of the team from West
                Germany.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the fledgling years of the Atari ST, The Exceptions
                established themselves as the premiere demo-group and inspired
                others to produce demos on the new machine. They networked with
                their peers in the virtual scene and contributed to the first
                "diskmag" <em>ST-NEWS,</em> a disk magazine with articles, scene
                news, reviews, and programming tips.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether they intended to or not, in their very first year, The
                Exceptions established the direction that Atari ST demos would
                take over the next years.

                Two years after the release of the ST, the Atari Corporation
                introduced a Blitter chip (Bit-Block Transfer Processor) for
                their computer that enabled it to shift larger amounts of
                graphics data smoothly. It was an optional add-on that did not
                catch on in gaming and only started to be used extensively with
                the introduction of the enhanced Atari STE that came with the
                Blitter built in by default.<br /><a
