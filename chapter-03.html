                This section is the center piece of the thesis. It provides a
                detailed analysis of the demos produced by The Exceptions and by
                other relevant demo-groups on the Atari ST in during the
                research period. The analysis will be based on hermeneutic
                interpretations of the demo art and its component images, music,
                and scrolling text from the perspective of what they depict,
                technical aspects, the tone, and the cultural perspective. As a
                means to evaluate the significance of demo art for media art
                history, the objective here is to learn about the limitations
                that the demo-makers managed to circumvent, the techniques they
                employed, and the messages they sent out to their audiences.

                The source for the demos examined is pouet.net, the historic
                demoscene archive introduced above. Where possible, the demos
                were screened on the original hardware, a modified Atari Mega
                STE. This machine was released five years after the Atari ST, so
                it is not 100% compatible. If a demo could not be run on the
                original hardware, it ran in the open-source Atari ST emulator
                Hatari on MacOS and on the FPGA retro computer MiST (see
                Appendix I on the conservation and preservation of demo art for
                further information on emulation).

                3.1 The Year 1987: The Humble Beginnings of the Demo Scene
              </h3>
              <p>
                This analysis starts with the 1987 Atari ST demos. While the
                Atari 520ST was introduced in 1985, it was only released to a
                wider audience in 1986. The Atari Corporation first provided
                small programs demonstrating the capabilities of the Atari ST
                for use at the point-of-sale, but these were limited to image
                slideshows showcasing the advanced graphics without any software
                tricks. The very first demo produced by crackers and demo-makers
                was released in 1987 by The Exceptions. It was the
                inconspicuously named <em>README.PRG.</em> The demo-group
                released three more demos in 1987 after README.PRG:
                <em>The Little Sound Demo (LSD),</em>
                <em>the Little Color Demo (LCD),</em> and the
                <em>Super-Neo-Demo-Show.</em>

              <h4>3.1.1 README.PRG</h4>
              <p>
                In March 1987, The Exceptions released the very first demo on
                the Atari ST, <strong>README.PRG.</strong> The file was barely
                80KB. Files named <em>README</em> usually contained instructions
                or supplementary information relevant to an application, so
                users would normally open this kind of file before using an
                application. The Exceptions did not provide a text file; they
                provided an executable program. When users ran it first in 1987,
                it baffled them.

              <p>
                Compared to later demos, it was rather restricted in scope.
                README.PRG was a single-screen demo with scrolling text. Roughly
                80% of the screen was occupied by an image created by Erik Simon
                (ES), and along the lower fifth, a scrolling text ran across an
                animated background.
              </p>

              <h5>3.1.1.1 The Elements of Design of the Readme Demo</h5>
              <p>
                The static graphic shows a lush fantasy landscape. The image's
                central piece is a red dragon perched on the base of the picture
                with wings spread wide. Visible in the distance behind the
                dragon is a temple made of square gray stones with what looks
                like a statue of a serpent's head hanging above the portal.
                Behind the temple's golden dome, there are gnarly gray mountains
                with other dragons flying between them. The sky is cloudy, but a
                bright gradient of colors stretches from the clouds to the
                mountains.
              </p>
              <p>
                The red dragon's arms are resting on a box with the initials
                "TEX" inscribed on it; the dragon's tail is tenderly wrapped
                around it, somewhat obscuring the letters. The dragon tilts its
                head downwards and breaths fire onto a red-and-white sphere,
                clearly identifiable as the Amiga ball from the earliest demos
                on the competing machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first thing that Atari ST users notice on the colorful
                screen are the many colors, more than the 16 colors that Atari
                ST usually displays. The sky's gradient already shows more than
                three dozen colors, far surpassing the ST's color limit; the
                hues of the temple, the shades of the mountains, and the
                saturated green of the meadows that are interfused with rich
                blue streams of water. In the center stands the red dragon with
                its venomous crimson tones, ripping into the landscape with
                flames engulfing the symbol of Amiga's superiority. While the
                dragon might well be interpreted as the Atari ST, it could well
                be the demo-makers themselves.

              <h5>3.1.1.2 The Scrolling Text</h5>
              <p>
                These are the full contents of the demo's scrolling text with
                all its charming errors (the original was in all caps; the quote
                is converted to mixed case to make it more readable):
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Hi there!!! Welcome to the first demo screen produced by the
                Exceptions (TEX)! Maybe you remember all those funny little
                programs called "demos" on the good old '64. Here's now the
                first one of it's kind on Jack's good new ST. Yes, we all know
                that these PRG's aren't good for nothing, except for two little
                things... you sit and wonder whats going on with your computer,
                and we're getting a lot of know-how.<br /><br />The Exceptions
                are: -ME- and ES<br /><br />
                All the code in our demo was written by -ME- (the king of
                interrupts!). Graphics, characterset, colors (many, many colors
                eh?) and text by ES. The music was "lended" from the game
                'Extensor'. Try the keys 1 - 5 (0 to escape demo)! We bet that
                you thought a softscrolling like this is impossible on a
                bitmap-machine like the st. But as you see… and it's even
                running on the VBL-IRQ! You don't know what the hell this means?
                Oh, no not again such a C-programmer! Long live 68000-assembly
                language!
                <br /><br />And now, what nobody wants to see: The greetings.<br /><br />
                Ok, hi to the few people we know: SSS, Softknight and Indy,
                although he doesn't like the ST... Oh yes: A very special hello
                to all the poor Amiga-owners who can't write assembly programs
                on their pretty lady (haw, haw, haw…)! To finance this program a
                little bit of advertising was necessary: 'listen all you people
                to the greatest blues-band on earth: The Dingsbums!!!! Motto: Es
                werd gegroovt un' werd gegröhlt un' mit em Bier de Hals geölt!
                Gigs everywhere round Germersheim!' Let's come to an end. Folks:
                excuse me if there are any 'bugs' in the text. I haven't solved
                enough Infocom-adventures yet. Bye for now. We're working on our
                second demo, the shape-out seems to be a little bit difficult.
                see you..."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                From the outset The Exceptions had already formulated a strong
                motivation to create demos: to prove that the cheaper computer,
                the Atari ST, was as capable as the pricier Commodore Amiga.
                From this perceived position of inferiority, the purpose of
                their demos was not only to look "cool" for the sake of it, but
                also to beat the competing 16-bit platform.
              </p>
              <p>
                Despite its charming spelling mistakes and Germanized English
                phrasing, the scrolling text of README.PRG reads like a simple
                manifesto. The graphics artist ES (Erik Simon) praises their
                work, commemorates the achievement of his partner Udo Fischer
                (-ME-), who coded the demo, and sends out greetings to their
                friends. But most of all, The Exceptions showed that they
                achieved something that was thought impossible: displaying many
                more colors at the same time than the Atari ST was deemed
                capable of showing and a soft scrolling text across the bottom
                of the screen. The background of the text even scrolls at a
                slightly slower pace, creating a parallax scrolling effect.
              </p>
              <p>
                All of these effects were only possible by coding natively and
                directly on the processor in assembly language, the last
                human-readable, but still very cryptic, language before reaching
                actual machine code composed of ones and zeros. The disadvantage
                of assembly language is that it requires deep knowledge of the
                computer's inner workings and requires a greater proficiency
                than the so-called higher programming languages, like C, Pascal,
                and BASIC. The big advantage is the sheer speed of execution of
                programs written in assembly language. A good assembler
                programmer is also not limited by any of the formalities and
                requirements that higher programming languages or the operating
                system impose; if an assembler coder manages to find a way to
                coerce the hardware into doing something, then it will work. The
                central processing unit (CPU) or processor of the Atari ST was
                the Motorola 68000. The same processor also beats at the heart
                of the Commodore Amiga, the original Apple Macintosh, and the
                Sega MegaDrive/Genesis.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their scrolling text, The Exceptions go on to mock anyone who
                cannot write 68000 assembly language, knowing full well that it
                is a daunting endeavor. Using a double entendre, ES calls anyone
                who does not know what VBL-IRQ means a C programmer. This might
                well be a programmer who writes code in the programming language
                C, or a class c (third-class) programmer.
              </p>
              <p>
                They go on to ridicule owners of the Commodore Amiga, but there
                seems to be a nod to the superiority of the Amiga. They call the
                machine a "pretty lady" and then exclaim a taunting onomatopoeic
                laugh, which can be read as a sexist, derogatory remark. It is
                also a play upon the Spanish meaning of the word "amiga" as
                girlfriend.
              </p>
              <p>
                In a latter section of the scrolling text, the writer alludes to
                advertising being necessary to finance the demo; this is quite
                likely tomfoolery. Both Erik Simon (ES) and Udo Fischer (-ME-)
                were fans of a band local to the town of Germersheim in the West
                German province of Rhineland-Palatinate (Rheinland-Pfalz). They
                go on to recount the motto of the band in German, which
                translates to:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "We groove, we shout, and we oil our throats with beer."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The text does have the occasional spelling mistake, but English
                was not the writer's first language. The punctuation is an
                interesting mix between German and French. Some of the opening
                quotes were the lower variety („...”) commonly used in German,
                while other quotes were a slightly wrong variation of the quotes
                used in French («...»), but as &laquo;...&raquo;. This does not
                mean much, except that the text was not proofread for mistakes.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the very end, the writer even apologizes for mistakes in the
                text, calling them bugs, and continues that he had not yet
                <em>"solved enough Infocom-adventures."</em> Infocom was a
                US-based software company known in the late 1970s through the
                late 1980s for their well-written text adventures, e.g.,
                <em>Zork, the Great Underground Empire,</em> or
                <em>The Leather Goddesses of Phobos.</em> These were a type of
                text-based interactive fiction where the player reads a
                description of a situation or scene and then types their
                commands (e.g., GO EAST, GET SWORD, LIGHT FIRE WITH MATCHES)
                into the command prompt. The program interprets the commands,
                leading the player onto different situations or scenes.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 2000 onward, this form would be retroactively named
                interactive fiction.<sup

                These text adventures were only available in English, and they
                have not been localized to this day because merely translating
                the descriptions would be insufficient. It would instead be
                required to adapt the text parser, the part of the application
                that interprets the commands, to a language other than English.
                However, English had its advantage, as players who were not
                fluent in English would learn a lot of the language by playing
                text adventures. They would expand their vocabulary and learn
                how to express themselves in a way that the English-language
                text parser would understand.
              </p>

                Before Erik Simon (ES), the writer of the scrolling text, bids
                farewell, he announces he and Udo Fischer (-ME-) are working on
                another demo.

              <h5>3.1.1.3 Technical Limitations Broken in README.PRG</h5>
              <p>
                The README demo broke several the Atari ST's technical
                limitations. At this point in time, The Exceptions only
                consisted of Udo Fischer (-ME-) and Erik Simon (ES), so they
                focused on graphics and scrolling. The Atari ST did not have any
                dedicated scrolling hardware capabilities, so programming smooth
                scrolling was up to smart programmers. The computer had a vast
                palette of 512 colors but was straddled with the 16
                color-limitation.<sup

                The Exceptions managed to produce:

              <ul>
                <li>

                How did The Exceptions manage to get that many colors on the
                screen at the same time? They used a technique called "raster
                interrupts." As the name suggests, this technique combines the
                "raster" method of drawing a screen image on a cathode ray tube
                monitor or television with the ability to "interrupt" a
                processor's work to produce small changes and immediately return
                to the original task.
              </p>
              <p>
                An "interrupt" is a signal from a computer's component sent to
                the main processor (CPU) to halt any operation in progress and
                jump to a specific routine in memory to do something else. After
                completing the task in the routine, the CPU resumes at exactly
                the point it was interrupted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The term "raster" is used to describe the scanlines on a
                computer screen (see <a href="#figure-20">figure 20</a>). A
                computer creates the screen image on the monitor line by line by
                feeding information to the electron beam that travels across the
                monitor or TV screen. This happened 50 times a second on the
                European screens and 60 times a second on US and North American
                screens due to the different electrical frequencies used in the
                regions.

                The Atari ST had three resolutions. The high and medium
                resolutions were conceived for business applications such as
                word processors, spreadsheets, databases, and desktop
                publishing, while the low resolution was the one The Exceptions
                used for their demos (and was used for most Atari games of the
                day).

                The low-res screen was 320 pixels wide and 200 pixels high. This
                area is a large part of the screen, but it does not occupy all
                of the screen because, in the 1980s and early 1990s, computer
                screens had a border around the main image. The smaller image
                area allowed the Atari ST to work with different TV standards
                (the PAL standard in Europe with a slightly larger available
                area but a lower frequency of 50Hz, and the NTSC standard in
                North America, with a small area but a higher screen refresh
                rate of 60Hz). The borders also keep the main image in the
                center of the screen, away from the curvature of the TV/monitor
                tube where it would suffer from less distortion (which was much
                greater towards the edges). Effectively, it means that around
                75% of the screen area was actually available to use (see

              <h5>3.1.1.4 Adapting the Scanline</h5>
              <p>
                A "raster interrupt" is an interrupt that is deliberately
                triggered when the electron beam that draws the raster of
                scanlines is at a certain scanline on the screen. The interrupt
                sends the processor to a routine that produces a change in the
                way the scanline is drawn, e.g., change the border color or the
                complete palette before the processor proceeds to the next
                scanline (see <a href="#figure-22">figure 22</a>). When the
                change induced by the interrupt has been registered, the
                processor resumes its previous task under the new conditions.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this case, the next scanline is drawn with a changed set of
                colors. This happens so quickly that the user does not notice
                any delay but is presented with much more colorful graphics than
                they thought possible. Unfortunately, the more interrupts a
                processor must handle, the less time it can spend on other
                tasks; if the processor must switch color palettes at every
                scanline, it will suffer a slight loss of performance. Precise
                timing is necessary to achieve the desired effects; the switch
                between two palettes must be completely free of flickering and
                distortions to look appealing and free of errors.

                In the README demo, the ST's palette switches multiple times on
                the main screen. The top section switches parts of the palette
                half a dozen times to accommodate the colorful gradient of the
                sky (only the colors necessary for the clouds and the mountains
                remained constant across most of the sky's palettes). Once the
                sky section no longer needs to be accounted for, the palettes
                only switch a few times until half of the screen has been drawn.

                The bottom half of the image actually has a single 16-color
                palette of greens, blues, and reds. The bottom quarter is
                occupied by the scrolling text, which consists of gold text on a
                purple background, which looks like it is scrolling in the
                opposite direction of the text. This section has a separate
                16-color palette composed of yellow tones for the gold of the
                text, and purple shades for the background. Only 14 colors are
                visible in this bottom section because two color registers are
                reserved for the transparency of the letters.
              </p>

              <h5>3.1.1.5 Silky Smooth Scrolling</h5>
              <p>
                The origins of the word "scrolling" might already be forgotten,
                but it means "screen rolling." Essentially, the computer is
                moving the contents of the screen in any direction. On the Atari
                ST, it makes no difference if the screen contains graphics or
                characters; for example, when you list a text file on the
                screen, the text scrolls up. More complex scrolling is common in
                arcades and video games, called "soft scrolling", where the
                graphics scroll smoothly across the screen without stuttering or
                jerking.
              </p>
              <p>
                In contrast to other computers of its generation (and even
                previous ones), the Atari ST had special chips or hardware to
                help with scrolling that had to be done with the ST's processor.
                To achieve this level of smoothness, there are several elements
                to be considered. The range of movement should not be too large,
                and the screen should refresh at 1/50th of a second, displaying
                the next phase of the scrolled contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions had a hard time figuring out how to produce
                smooth horizontal scrolling on the Atari ST. They found that
                vertical scrolling was easy, but they wanted to use it for their
                scrolling text where the letters travel from the right to the
                left so that the viewer can read them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The reason for the ST's difficulty with horizontal scrolling is
                the way it creates graphics. A bitmap image is composed of
                sequences of words (two bytes) in memory which contain 16 pixels
                of image information. If you want to shift the whole screen
                image or a part of it by one pixel up or down, it is sufficient
                to move the block of memory by a word, and the CPU can do this
                very quickly and smoothly. If you want to shift the screen
                horizontally, from right to left (or the other way), then the
                increment of a full word (two bytes or 16 pixels) is too large.
                Shifting the screen by less than a word means the actual bit
                content of each word must be moved. The 68000 CPU can handle
                about 32 lines, but anything beyond that would require its full
                focus, leaving no performance capacity for other operations,
                like music or setting up any other contents.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions needed to avoid any scrolling operations that ran
                on a bit-level. Shifting a full word at a time was not smooth
                enough because that shifts the screen by 16-pixel increments and
                causes a stutter. Therefore, Udo Fischer developed a technique
                that used eight buffers, and the screen graphics were stored
                pre-shifted in two-pixel increments in each of these buffers.
                When the Atari ST needed to display the next step of a scrolling
                image, it retrieved the pre-shifted graphics from the next
                buffer. When seven buffers with the pre-shifted images were
                displayed, the processor shifted the original graphic by a full
                word of 16 pixels and displayed this next. To save time needed
                to copy the buffer contents to the screen, The Exceptions used
                eight virtual screens in memory and shifted the address of the
                graphics memory from one buffer to the next. The primary
                disadvantage of this method was that it was extremely memory
                intensive. At 32KB per screen buffer, this meant that the ST had
                to occupy 256KB in total for all eight buffers to achieve smooth
                scrolling.

              <p>
                When The Exceptions created their README.PRG demo, the only
                members were Udo Fischer and Erik Simon. They had programming
                and graphics covered, but they did not have a musician. For
                their first demo's music, they simply used the tune from the
                game <em>Extensor,</em> which sounded great and did a good job
                of using the mediocre sound chip of the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions released their second demo a few months after
                README, and it focused on music. In the
                <strong>Little Sound Demo,</strong> the newest member of The
                Exceptions, Mad Max Jochen Hippel, was the true star. He had
                faithfully converted tunes from the Commodore 64 to the Atari
                ST. Though from a previous computer generation, the C64's SID
                chip was superior to the ST's YM-chip, and Mad Max meticulously
                converted a total of 16 minutes of music from games on the
                Commodore 64 that famed composer and chip musician Rob Hubbard
                wrote for <em>International Karate,</em>
                <em>Monty on the Run,</em> <em>Commando,</em> and
                <em>Flash Gordon.</em> Mad Max composed four more tunes for the
                Atari's YM/AY chip.
              </p>
              <p>
                Rob Hubbard was a commercial music composer for video games, and
                at the time, was still actively writing music for 8-bit systems.
                His music was particularly popular on the Commodore 64, where he
                managed to write some of the most exciting game music that often
                exceeded the game in quality. In many cases, users would
                purchase games specifically because the game music was written
                by Hubbard.
              </p>
              <p>
                He was well-known in the niche circle of gamers in the 1980s,
                and in 2016, Hubbard received an honorary doctorate from Abertay
                University for his gaming music.<sup

                >
                In 2019, Hubbard performed his 8-bit music rearranged for a full

                But in 1987, writing music that was as good as Hubbard's was the
                Holy Grail in the demoscene, and the Little Sound Demo,
                naughtily abbreviated as LSD, lived up to this promise.

                The demo still only featured one screen and a scrolling text.
                The top half showed a cartoon depiction of the Atari ST with
                eyes and a mouth spitting a music note on a Commodore 64 that
                itself had a look of bemusement, sticking out its cartoon tongue
                when hit by the note. The right showed the logo of The
                Exceptions and the name of the demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The graphics were not the demo's strong suit; rather, it was the
                sound. Users could hit the keys A to L on their Atari's keyboard
                and listen to faithful conversions from game music composed by
                Rob Hubbard and four original pieces by Mad Max. The music
                conversion was reasonably faithful, given the SID-chip's
                superiority over the ST's limited YM-chip. This was Mad Max's
                first attempt, and his efforts would improve in later demos.

                The scrolling text was again full of bragging, but with no

                Some tunes are incomplete because you can imagine how difficult
                it is to reach all the effects of the SID. But Mad Max is

                The Exceptions were full of praise for their newest member. The
                team had found its musician, and they were ready to produce the
                next demo with even more music.

              <h5>3.1.2.1 The Elements of Design of the Little Sound Demo</h5>
              <p>
                The intention of the graphic is clear: the Atari ST acts
                defiantly towards the Commodore 64. The execution, however, is
                anything but clear.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you know what the computers look like, you will probably
                recognize them in their pixel-painted and curved depictions in
                the graphic. The musical note spewed from the ST to the C64 is
                also still clearly recognizable. Identifying the white cartoon
                lines that form the Atari ST's and Commodore 64's "eyes" and
                "mouth" is much more difficult. The disparity in style between
                those elements based on simplistic white lines and full-colored,
                detailed rendering of the computers make a visual connection
                difficult.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the scene is caged in a gray gradient tube frame that
                restricts the contents and serves no discernible purpose. This
                demo's focus is most definitely on the sound and music and not
                on the graphical aspects.

              <h5>3.1.2.2 Meeting Mad Max</h5>
              <p>
                Udo Fischer and Erik Simon had met Jochen Hippel in a computer
                shop in Mannheim, Rhineland-Palatinate. The shop was a meeting
                place, and ironically, customers met each other there to pirate
                games instead of purchasing the software available. They crossed
                paths again and again in ST user clubs in the towns of Ramsen
                and Bad Dürkheim.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the time, Jochen Hippel was 15 years old. Despite his young
                age, he had already programmed music routines on the Commodore
                64 that sounded very much like the music of Rob Hubbard. At
                school, Jochen Hippel attracted attention because he had created
                rock versions of Christmas songs in computer class. Jochen did
                not own an Atari ST yet but was interested in the system.
              </p>
              <p>
                As soon as Hippel received his own Atari ST, the two members of
                The Exceptions pleaded him to join them and create music for
                their demos (and later-on, commercial games). He simply said,
                "Why not?" and joined them. The team had found their music
                specialist in Mad Max.

              <h5>3.1.2.3 Converting SID to YM</h5>
              <p>
                To convert the original Hubbard tunes from the C64's SID was
                particularly challenging. There was no music notation of the
                songs, but the programming code could be pulled from the games.
                Mad Max could look at the original composition in hexadecimal
                code, but then had to calculate the new code for the Atari ST
                and meticulously convert each note to the capabilities of the
                more limited sound chip (see
                <a href="#figure-25">figure 25</a>).<sup

                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-origin-03-46"

                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This conversion process ended up being very time consuming, so
                in the Little Sound Demo, the only complete pieces were from
                <em>International Karate,</em> the main theme from
                <em>Commando</em> and <em>Flash Gordon.</em> One of the original
                pieces by Mad Max was inspired by the <em>Marche Funebre</em> by
                Frederic Chopin.

              <h4>3.1.3 Little Color Demo (LCD)</h4>
              <p>
                The <strong>Little Color Demo</strong> was the third demo by The
                Exceptions in 1987. According to their scrolling text, they
                completed it at the end of May, and it featured even more music
                that Mad Max had converted from games on the Commodore 64.
                Beyond that, the LCD had two scrolling messages: one vertical
                message and what appeared to be the tried-and-tested horizontal
                scrolling text of the previous demos, but with even more colors
                on screen beyond the machine's capabilities.
              </p>
              <p>
                To commemorate Rob Hubbard, Erik drew a small graphic of the
                musician saying, "Wow!" because the tunes were even more
                faithful conversions of the original SID music. The vertical
                scrolling text had a barrel distortion effect. The screen looked
                like it extended beyond the borders, which in fact, was only a
                fake "No-Border-effect" because the graphics did not really
                protrude into the border area. Rather, the border color was
                changed in the lower part of the screen to match the screen
                content, only creating the impression of no borders. From a
                historic perspective, this was the first demo to feature a
                "reset screen": a screen that could only be accessed by pressing
                the reset button on the side of the Atari ST. It was a testament
                to the programming capabilities of The Exceptions that they
                could even intercept signals sent to the hardware reset button
                of the computer and deviate from it (see
                <a href="#figure-27">figure 27</a>).

              <p>
                The scrolling text of this demo teased that it looked the same
                as in the previous demos and thus was "boring." But then, it
                suddenly transformed into a multitude of colors, and users could
                press the keys A to H to select the music. The real-time
                equalizer in the screen's center showed the real operating
                capacity of each of the YM-chip's three voices. To show off even
                more effects, The Exceptions had added two rotating 3D Atari
                symbols to the left and right of the equalizer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The vertical scroller at the top only had a short text and
                featured greetings (something lacking in the previous Little
                Sound Demo). The full text of the vertical scroller was quite
                short:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Here we go again!!! The 3rd demo made by The Exceptions. TEX

              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The horizontal scrolling text erupted in technicolor grandeur,
                yet still used the font established in the first README demo.
                The contents of the horizontal scrolling text lambast the ST's
                sound chip at the same time, lauding the valiant musical efforts
                of Mad Max. It ends with the announcement that The Exceptions
                will now give other demo-makers a chance to produce superior
                demos:

                According to their scrolling text, The Exceptions were going to
                take a break and challenge other demo-makers to produce their
                own demos. This turned out to be a wrong assumption, as they
                ended up contributing to another demo in September of 1987.

              <p>
                The graphics in the Little Color Demo are simpler and less
                playful than in the previous demo. The screen is crowded with
                little sense of distribution of the design elements, making it
                look like the artist panicked that any space left unused might
                be held against him. The elegance and use of colors from the
                first demo's dragon image are no longer found; instead it was
                replaced by generated effects, like the vertical scroller and
                the equalizer as centerpieces, yet drowned out by the odd
                repetition of the Rob Hubbard portrait image and Atari's
                spinning Fuji logo in front of the barely-recognizable TEX logo.

                Yet, this is all contrasted by the horizontal scrolling text
                below with its multicolored magnificence, radiating down each of
                the letters and making them resemble eccentric chameleons as if
                they have only ever seen Kandinsky's color studies through
                Vaseline-smeared lenses.

              <h5>3.1.3.2 Atari ST and Music Production</h5>
              <p>
                There are a few potential misconceptions about the Atari ST and
                its music capabilities that should be addressed at this point.
                The ST was popular and used frequently in the music industry.
                Musicians like Depeche Mode, Jean-Michel Jarre, and the Pet Shop
                Boys used the Atari ST in their studios.<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-origin-03-47"

                  ></sup
                >
                It is important to note that they used the computer to enter
                their music compositions into a sequencer application. The Atari
                ST was attached to professional music synthesizers via its
                integrated Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) ports and
                provided instructions to the synthesizers to play the music
                sequences. The ST was the only computer of its time to come with
                MIDI ports by default.
              </p>
              <p>
                By comparison, the actual sound chip that the computer used to
                generate music and in-game effects was merely pedestrian. Users
                at the time were surprised that a modern computer like the ST
                had such a dated sound chip in the YM-2149F. Mad Max famously
                said about the YM-chip: "Atari built in a totally outmoded sound
                chip into the most modern computer." The Commodore Amiga had far
                better sound hardware, and even the Commodore 64 had a superior
                sound chip.
              </p>
              <p>
                This ambivalence led to the contradictory situation where the
                Atari ST had become the computer for professional musicians
                because it could control instruments, while game developers,
                chip musicians, and demo-makers had a hard time generating music
                from the internal sound chip.

                The Exceptions wanted to become legitimate game developers.
                While talented, they were also young and inexperienced, and
                therefore needed to find the right project and the right game
                publisher. This also meant that they would not have the time to

                This intrigued the Exceptions; they wanted to try this in
                practice. Udo Fischer (-ME-) managed to display complete images
                created by Erik Simon and other artists, and then he utilized
                the lower border for the scrolling text. No more small images
                due to the space requirements of the scrolling text! He even
                managed to add rasters for more colors and to play Mad Max's
                music with digital sound effects.

                To call this a demo might be a bit of an exaggeration because it
                is actually a slideshow of six images. The images were
                predominantly fantasy-themed pixel art produced by Erik Simon
                and his friends. K. Miller pixel-painted an ST version of Smaug
                from J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Hobbit,</em> based on the original
                painting by the painting brothers Hildebrandt (see
                <a href="#figure-28">figures 28</a> and
                <a href="#figure-29">29</a>). ES painted the movie poster of the
                animated feature <em>The Last Unicorn</em> and painter Rowena
                Morrill's cover for Piers Anthony's fantasy novel
                <em>Vision of Tarot.</em> The other images are King Tut (a
                mainstay of 16-bit graphics due to the reflections on the death
                mask), and a Porsche Turbo Carrera (see
                <a href="#figure-30">figure 30</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The pictures were predominantly drawn by hand using the classic
                ST paint application <em>NEOchrome.</em> The whole demo screen
                makes use of more than 16 colors; the images themselves were
                pixel-painted within the ST's limitations of 16 colors, proving
                that the right artist can produce great results even within
                these limitations. The paint application NEOChrome's name is
                referenced in the name of the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.

                The extraordinary feature of this demo is the premiere on the
                Atari ST. For the first time, the demo-makers managed to remove
                the lower border; the scrolling text occupies a part of the
                lower border, and Erik Simon designed a new font for it. The
                lower part of the border is emblazoned with the TEX logo
                surrounded by little propellers spinning animatedly, proving
                that there really are graphics in the border.

              <h5>3.1.4.1 From Sketchpad via MacPaint to NEOChrome</h5>
              <p>
                Erik "ES" Simon preferred the paint application NEOChrome. It
                was the paint application included with Atari ST's when the
                computer was first released. The application can be compared to
                a color version of <em>MacPaint</em> that was released a year
                prior on the Apple Macintosh and shares many of the same user
                interface elements and tools (see
                <a href="#figure-33">figure 33</a>). Except for the ST's use of
                color, the big difference is that in NEOChrome, the tools were
                not aligned on the side of the screen. They occupied the half
                the screen together with the color palette and zoom function
                that was always active (see <a href="#figure-32">figure 32</a>).
              </p>

                NEOChrome's great advantage was its simplicity. It had the main
                paint tools and some limited animation capabilities, but it kept
                Erik Simon focused on the process of painting instead of being
                distracted by too many functions or by the complexity of the
                tool.

                Both MacPaint and NEOChrome can trace their origin back to
                SketchPad developed by Ivan Sutherland in 1962, which was the
                first painting and drawing program ever developed (see
                <a href="#figure-34">figure 34</a>). In "Virtual Art: From
                Illusion to Immersion" pioneer of new media art histories Oliver
                Grau describes the importance of Sketchpad:

              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "...Sketchpad enabled the user to draw directly onto the monitor
                with a hand-held lightpen and thus offered the option of
                manipulating images directly on the screen: the basic
                prerequisite for interaction with virtual realities. Sketchpad
                was the precursor of graphics programs such as Adobe Illustrator
                or MacDraw, which replaced the abstract word-commands, that is,
                syntax, interface with the interface of pointing at icons with a
                device, that is, physical action, which was also much easier to

                Using a mouse instead of a lightpen, but tracing its heritage
                directly to Sketchpad, the intuitiveness of NEOChrome enabled
                Erik Simon and The Exceptions to create the artwork necessary
                for this completely unexpected demo, the Super-Neo-Demo-Show.

              <h5>
                3.1.4.2 Technical Limitations Broken in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show
              </h5>
              <p>
                The greatest achievement of this demo was the premiere of
                graphics in the lower border of the ST's screen. Alyssa opened
                the lower border at the end of the normal screen area on line
                199 by briefly switching the screen frequency from 50Hz
                (European standard) to 60Hz (North American standard), and then
                switching back to 50Hz. The ST's Shifter chip handles the
                graphics, then displays an additional 47 scanlines of graphics.
                In this way, the Super-Neo-Demo-Show had an effective screen
                resolution of 320 x 246 pixels, exceeding the limits provided by
                Atari.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finding a way to open up the bottom border was the first
                elementary step that would later lead to conquering all the
                other screen borders. This gave them the first idea of a method
                to achieve what was thought to be impossible on the Atari ST:
                using the full screen without any borders, called overscan. The
                Commodore Amiga is capable of using the full overscan area out
                of the box.
              </p>
              <p>
                When Alyssa discovered this trick, he demonstrated it in an
                intro but did not release it to the public. He revealed the
                technique to Udo Fisher (-ME-) of The Exceptions, who used it in
                the Super-Neo-Demo-Show. The Atari ST demoscene wracked their
                brains about how this could have been achieved, and the
                Exceptions disclosed the secret in their B.I.G.-Demo in 1988
                (described below). Interested demo-makers had to sit through the
                longest scrolling text up to that point because the sync switch
                technique was only revealed at the very end of the text.

              <p>
                Even after their first year of demos, The Exceptions still
                cracked games and distributed them. Game publisher Novagen's
                <em>Backlash</em> was one of them. While the game itself is a
                commendable first effort at producing a cut-down clone of Sega's
                arcade smash-hit <em>Space Harrier,</em> the interesting part
                was not in the game itself. The Exceptions had produced the
                <strong>Backlash Cracktro</strong> for the game, an intro for
                the cracked version.

              </p>

              <p>
                In their cracktro, they had the already-established mix of
                snappy music by Mad Max and a variant of their logo resplendent
                across the screen. This was the first time that the top and the
                lower border were used in a demo or intro in a stable way. This
                technique is called "synclock" rasters. While they did not put
                any graphics in the borders, The Exceptions used sophisticated
                palette switching (rasters) across the top and bottom border to
                show a kaleidoscope spread across the whole width (see
                <a href="#figure-35">figure 35</a>). The main display area also
                made "synclocks," the rasters on the left and right create the
                impression of spreading the background into the borders. The
                technique is particularly difficult because it requires in-depth
                knowledge of the ST's hardware and ample experimentation to
                synchronize (sync) the program code in lock with the electron
                beam of the display.
              </p>

              <h5>3.1.5.1 The Elements of Design of the Backlash Intro</h5>
              <p>
                The compositions of the Backlash Cracktro is undoubtedly
                crowded. There was no weighting applied to its elements, and no
                apparent thought put into its use of space. The Exceptions' logo
                is rendered in a sparkling golden aesthetic that signals "bling"
                and the impression of having spared no costs.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <em>Backlash</em> logo was not created by Erik Simon but
                taken from the game itself. It nevertheless matches the other
                imagery with garish and unbalanced colors. That being said, the
                image bursts with unbridled energy and enthusiasm; it never
                claimed to aspire to be balanced, to unapologetically throw
                color and form at its audiences.

              <h5>3.1.5.2 New Demo-Groups on the Atari ST</h5>
              <p>
                Other cracker groups began producing demos inspired not only by
                The Exceptions, but other factors as well. Demo-making was a
                phenomenon that spanned across all computer systems, but The
                Exceptions were one of the major motivating factors on the Atari
                ST. Other demo-makers started to match the colors, graphics,
                music, and sound effects of The Exceptions' first few demos, but
                they also set out to deliver on the next challenge: using the
                top border of the screen. Another team, the TNT-Crew around
                Michael Bittner (Hexagon), came very close to be the first to do
                so. Level 16 and the TNT-Crew were already independently working
                on "synclock" rasters when The Exceptions beat them to it with
                their cracktro to <em>Backlash.</em> Despite this, there was
                still much room for improvement. No one had yet put graphics
                into the top border.
              </p>
              <p>
                Two years later in 1989, the three teams joined forces to become
                part of the Union, a conglomerate of demo-groups.

              <h4>3.1.6 The Achievements in 1987</h4>
              <p>
                In the first year of real ST demos, The Exceptions started out
                as a cracking group with a few intro screens in front of their
                cracked games. Then, they released their first demo that broke
                the Atari ST's color limitation. Admittedly, they were not the
                first to do so, as the art application NEOchrome from the Atari
                Corporation had managed to display 222 colors, 208 of which were
                in the color picker. However, The Exceptions were the first to
                produce artwork in more than 16 colors. They also combatted the
                prejudice that the Atari ST was not capable of smooth horizontal
                scrolling by producing horizontal scrolling text.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their first demo, The Exceptions established their rivalry
                with the Commodore Amiga, the technically superior and, at the
                time, far more expensive machine. They aspired to match the
                technical and artistic feats on the computer of their choice. On
                the one hand, this was out of a feeling of having chosen the
                possibly inferior machine; on the other hand, it was playful
                banter and living up to the challenge of achieving some of the
                same Amiga demo effects on the ST that should by not have been
                as capable.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their next two demos, they addressed the limitations of the
                ST's sound hardware by producing music that was comparable to
                the superior SID chip in the Commodore 64. In all of their
                demos, they reached out to a virtual community of crackers and
                demo-makers, handing out kudos and greetings, yet still
                provoking their peers to produce their own works.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the year ended, The Exceptions found their first
                collaboration in a demo. Together with fellow demo-coder Alyssa,
                they took the first step in breaching the limitations of the
                screen borders by removing the lower border of the ST's screen.
                Again, this was not only thought impossible, but also something
                that only the Commodore Amiga could achieve.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their demos' graphics and effects were influenced by fantasy and
                science fiction, the aesthetic borrowed from computer games.
                They taught themselves the necessary skills to produce their
                work. Erik Simon (ES) learned to pixel-paint without much to
                reference, except for the finished works of others. Udo Fischer
                (-ME-) taught himself to write Motorola 68000 assembly code, and
                at first not even on a machine with that processor but using a
                simulator on the 8-bit Commodore 64. Jochen Hippel (Mad Max)
                mastered music-making by copying his idol Rob Hubbard and
                converting his favorite game music to the less capable sound
                chip of the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                The language in the scrolling texts of The Exceptions was a
                combination of self-aggrandization with some jabs at their
                peers, yet oddly self-deprecating about their work. It sounded
                like they knew how good their skills were, but that the results
                they delivered always fell somewhat short of their own
                aspirations.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1987, no other full demos were produced on the Atari ST.
                Peers of The Exceptions still released their work as intro
                screens to cracked games, though other demo-groups like Level 16
                and the TNT-Crew mobilized on the ST. It would take until 1988
                for other demo-groups to match the work of the team from West
                Germany.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the fledgling years of the Atari ST, The Exceptions
                established themselves as the premiere demo-group and inspired
                others to produce demos on the new machine. They networked with
                their peers in the virtual scene and contributed to the first
                "diskmag" <em>ST-NEWS,</em> a disk magazine with articles, scene
                news, reviews, and programming tips.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether they intended to or not, in their very first year, The
                Exceptions established the direction that Atari ST demos would
                take over the next years.

              <p>
                In the following years, other demo-groups started to form and
                release their demos. Many came from the cracker scene, pirating
                games, and now creating demos. The Exceptions started to attract
                the attention of computer magazines, exposing them to a greater
                readership. They published a series in a commercial print
                magazine, and they worked on their first commercial computer
                game. Even though it looked like they were leaving the
                demoscene, they wanted to go out with a bang. And what a bang it
                was'; one might even refer to it as a B.I.G. bang!

              <h4>3.2.1 B.I.G. Demo</h4>
              <p>
                The <strong>B.I.G. Demo</strong> called itself the "Best In
                Galaxy" demo and represented the culmination of The Exceptions'
                work up to this point. It included more than 100 tunes converted
                from the Commodore 64, displayed an increased number of colors,
                and the lower screen border removed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Udo Fischer (-ME-), Erik Simon (ES), and Jochen Hippel (Mad Max)
                were now joined by Michael Raasch (Daryl) and Gunter Bitz (6719)
                to create the first megademo by a single demo-group.<sup

                >
                The whole B.I.G. demo ran on a 512KB machine and was stored on
                one single-sided disk, which had a capacity of 360KB.
              </p>
              <p>
                It featured 113 music tunes, three so-called "Psych-O-Screens"
                with the latest effects and a screen with the longest text
                scroller ever packed into a demo so far. In addition, when you
                pressed the reset button on the computer, you would get a hidden
                custom reset screen.
              </p>

              <h5>3.2.1.1 Main Screen</h5>
              <p>
                The main screen showed a selection of all the 113 music tunes
                converted at an even higher fidelity from games on the Commodore
                64 than in the Little Sound Demo and the Little Color Demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                Users navigated the song list using the cursor keys. By hitting
                "1," "2," or "3," they changed to the Psych-O-Screens and "B"
                would open the B.I.G.-Scroller.

                If you listened to all the music, it would take more than four
                hours, with tunes that range from happy to melancholic, from pop
                to rock. Some of the 113 games on the Commodore 64 are
                <em>Sanxion,</em> <em>Lightforce,</em>
                <em>Master of Magic,</em> <em>Monty On The Run,</em>
                <em>Crazy Comets,</em> <em>Thing On A Spring,</em> and
                <em>Auf Wiedersehen Monty</em> (see
                <a href="#figure-36">figure 36</a>).
              </p>
              <p>
                The scrolling text occupied the bottom part of the screen in the
                lower border. Erik Simon (ES) used a similarly shaped font to
                the Super-Neo-Demo-Show, except that in the B.I.G.-Demo, it was
                much more colorful. It looked like it was embossed in the gray
                background with multicolored highlights running diagonally
                across each letter.
              </p>
              <p>
                As can be seen in the screenshot above, a horizontal tubular
                gradient bar starts within the left border, crosses the main
                display area, and extends into the right border. At the bottom
                of the screen, the shadow covers part of the scrolling text.
                Both the shadow and the bar were achieved by changing the
                palette registers of the border color, making it look like the
                main contents extend across the left and right. Beneath the
                scroller, even further into the lower border, the top half of
                the logo of TEX protrudes into the screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first and main screen of the B.I.G.-Demo is gray with some
                multicolored highlights. While not exactly the most exciting
                screen, it is well balanced compared to the previous two demos.
                It provides instructions to change the music and to switch to
                the impressive parts of the demo: the insanely technicolored
                Psycho-O-Screens.

                wide as the full screen with borders moves up and down. When the
                bar reaches the cube, it stretches behind the logo, but in front
                of the front-facing surface of the cube. At the same time, the
                bar protrudes behind the cube's sides, something that, according
                to all laws of perspective, should in fact be displayed behind
                the bar. This Esherian contraption is emphasized by the
                patterned frame of colors of a single tone that encase it,
                though the multicolor bar pierces it. All the while the colors
                of the frame pulsate in different colors fading in and out of
                multiple palettes of related shades (see

                alone for long. Starting from the left, multicolored scanlines
                start to fill the black background with vivid radiance until the
                whole width of the screen is covered (see
                <a href="#figure-40">figure 40</a>). Beneath it all, a gray fish
                inexplicably hovers in the Atari ST's lower border.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only now, as the screen is full of interrupted scanlines of
                vibrance, can we see a handful of spherical silhouettes right
                next to the fish. Perhaps these are technicolor bubbles leaving
                the fish's mouth (see <a href="#figure-41">figure 41</a>).

                On the second Psych-O-Screen, The Exceptions outdo themselves in
                the multitude of colors on the screen at the same time; a number
                close to the full available spectrum of the Atari ST's 512
                colors. Surreal shapes in color space are the theme of this
                image, therefore it makes perfect sense that The Exceptions
                whimsically post the following text above their epic sea of

                If one could call the previous Psych-O-Screen merely colorful,
                then this third screen explodes with surreal colors like a
                digital Jackson Pollock on LSD. The Exceptions push the color
                limits and use as much of the borders as possible. Despite what
                the other screens showed, they had not yet managed to draw
                actual graphics into the side borders. Thus far, they could only
                produce straight horizontal lines in the left and right overscan
                area. These techniques fill the whole Psych-O-Screen (see
                <a href="#figure-42">figure 42</a>).

                They created a Psych-O-Screen with hundreds of interleaved lines

                extended into all the borders, except for the top border. This

                For the final trick, The Exceptions also included a reset
                screen. When the user pressed the reset button on their Atari
                ST, the computer did not reboot as it should by default. Showing
                a bomb on the screen was the standard way the Atari ST's
                operating system to report a system crash, an error, or an
                <em>exception.</em> But in this case, the bomb started to
                multiply and turn into a cartoon version of the system icon. The
                Exceptions had caught the reset command and created a mock
                screen with cartoon versions of the bomb.

                are more than 7,000 words at 42KB. Could it be that these 42KB
                were used deliberately because according to Douglas Adams in
                "The Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy", the number 42 is the

              <h5>3.2.1.7 A Reading of the Scrolling Text</h5>
              <p>
                In this section, the focus will be on the examination of the
                scrolling text. It is the longest scrolling text in any of their
                demos up to this point, and therefore provides insights into the
                self-proclaimed intentions and thinking of the demo-makers. From
                the onset, it should be established that the majority of the
                text was not produced by the core members of the Exceptions, but
                rather by Richard Karsmakers (Cronos from the Amazing Cracking
                Conspiracy)<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-origin-03-53"

                  ></sup
                >, the editor of the diskmag <em>ST-NEWS</em> who helped the
                demo-makers start on this demo effort and distributed and
                advertised the demo once it was completed. That being said, the
                demo itself is the work of The Exceptions. They would not allow
                the text to contain anything that contradicts their intentions
                and thinking. The scrolling is summarized below.
              </p>
              <p>
                After the introduction, with a description of the contents and
                features of the demo, the writer states the playtime of all the
                music combined and the length of the scrolling text. Then, the
                writer praises the contributors of the music, the code, the
                graphics, and himself before decrying the Atari ST's YM-2149
                sound chip and graphics hardware. The next section is a list of
                credits for the demo's contributors. This is followed by a list
                of the records broken by the demo, which include the number of
                pieces of music, their total length, the length of the scrolling
                message, and the admirable achievement of compressing it all to
                a single-sided floppy disk.
              </p>
              <p>
                The longest section is the greetings to other members of the
                scene. They range from members of the Atari ST demoscene,
                demo-makers on other systems, developers of commercial software
                on the ST, as well as people at the Atari Corporation who helped
                develop the machine. The language tropes used are playful
                insults, boasts, and other competitive linguistic forms to
                create sociality in the burgeoning demoscene on the Atari ST.
                Some of the greetings have playful remarks, such as "Amiga
                Software Syndicate (though they are working on the wrong
                machine)." While not explicitly stated, there are only men on
                the list.
              </p>
              <p>
                Three of the "greetings" were disrespectful messages directed at
                groups whom The Exceptions despised for acting dishonorably: the
                cracking groups <em>HSS</em> that distributed programs that were
                not copy-protected by their publishers (but HSS credited
                themselves as having cracked the copy protection). the cracker
                group named <em>Klu Klux Clan Conspiracy</em> in bad taste, and
                <em>Strike Force.</em> Both wrongfully credited themselves with
                the cracks done by others:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                "HSS (the biggest cocksucker around, that always puts his name
                in programs that others cracked, writes 'cracked by' in loading
                pictures of non-protected software, and that has to watch his
                steps before someone will punch his bleedin' nose)
                <br /><br />

                in front of programs they didn't even crack - using routines
                they pinched from others)."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Richard Karsmakers and The Exceptions use strong language in
                this section. It is not only offensive, but also sexually
                violent and homophobic and departs in tone from the other
                sections. This strong language was deliberately chosen to attack
                the cracker groups. These paragraphs provide an insight into the
                unspoken "codex" of the scene, where claiming merits is the
                primary currency. Wrongfully claiming credit is regarded as a
                violation of this codex. The Exceptions express their anger and
                dissatisfaction with these groups who acted dishonorably.
              </p>
              <p>
                The writers are not native English-speakers. Derogatory
                vernacular in the 1980s was pejoratively directed at sexuality
                as offensive slurs. From a modern perspective, this is not
                acceptable and does not conform to our present-day cultural
                norms nor political correctness. In the context of the times and
                hyper-masculine action movies of the 1980s as watched by this
                generation of young men, the choice of words is offensive, but
                not unusual.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the next section, there is an interesting duality. Richard
                Karsmakers' demoscene handle is Cronos, he is part of the
                <em>Amazing Cracking Conspiracy (ACC),</em> and he works on
                ST-NEWS under his real name, yet in this text, he uses his scene
                handle. To create distance between his civilian identity and his
                scene identity, he praises the work of ST-NEWS as though he is
                not a contributor:

                There is a mildly profane message to the
                <em>"motherfucker that brought the virus on the ST."</em>
                Karsmakers elaborates that
                <em

                This was the age when viruses were distributed through infected
                floppy disks, and in some cases, as infected files in a Bulletin
                Board System (BBS). Getting a virus into circulation in this way
                was a very deliberate act. Karsmakers closes with a humorous
                death curse to the virus maker

                The next section lists metrics related to the creation of the
                demo, e.g., the number of developer hours that went into the
                development (2,019 hours), the number of bottles of soft drinks,
                beer, and wine, as well as the cups of tea and coffee that they
                drank during this time. The metrics go on to list materials used
                like diskettes, adhesive strips, paper, and other materials.
                They list all the computers they used. Oddly enough, this
                includes not only the Atari and Commodore 64, but also a
                Commodore Amiga and an Apple Macintosh II (which at the time was
                prohibitively expensive). They praise the applications they
                used, which includes another praise for the pixel-paint
                application NEOchrome.

                What follows is the "obligatory" Amiga vs. ST section. The
                competition between platforms has been a motivating factor for
                the demo-makers on the ST since the very beginning:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Now, many Atari ST users start throwing up when they hear
                someone mentioning the Amiga, and nearly all Amiga users truly
                think the Atari ST is a heap of shit (and the worst thing is
                that they really think it is a heap of shit, whereas Atari ST
                users just talk negatively about the Amiga for jealousy
                reasons). That jealousy, by the way, grows less and less by the
                day because demo programs like this start appearing on the ST,
                together with more and more excellent games and other programs."

              <p>
                This section evokes the inherent technological tribalism of the
                demoscene. It specifically addresses the envy that owners of the
                Atari ST feel toward the Amiga's superior capabilities. The text
                states that Amiga owners look down on the ST for being the
                inferior machine. Certainly, some Amiga owners and demo-makers
                held the Atari ST and, by extension, its owners in contempt, but
                this was not as widespread an opinion in the Amiga demoscene.
                Many ST demos poked at the Amiga, yet very few Amiga demos
                attacked the ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next section was a useful set of instructions on how to wire
                the ST's monitor port to an amplifier for stereo sound. This was
                followed very late in the scrolling text by the instructions on
                how to use the B.I.G. Demo, how to access the different
                Psych-O-Screens, and how to change the music. To be fair, the
                abbreviated instructions are also listed on the main screen.
              </p>
              <p>
                The writers then describe the distribution model of the demo.
                This is generally how most demos on most computer systems were
                distributed: freely and as part of the "public domain" software
                scene. This is not the same legal term for intellectual property
                that is no longer copyrighted, but a by-now-extinct model of
                software distribution where public domain software libraries
                would distribute software that had explicitly been made
                available by its creators. Usually, the only costs that could be
                charged were for the disk and the effort to make the copy,
                therefore they remained affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is striking that The Exceptions urge for the free and wide
                distribution of their demo in this section. They also ask for
                donations. This is in 1988, nearly a decade before the
                prevalence of the free and open-source software movement.

              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Ok. In just a few seconds, -ME- from the Exceptions will start
                explaining how border scrolling techniques work. If you have not
                yet fetched your notepad and pencil, please prepare yourself for
                a mind-boggling piece of constant memory....
                <br /><br />
                Here it is...."
                <br /><br />[...]<br /><br />

                "...if you remember our super-neo-demo-show you might have
                noticed a mistake in the pictures in the bottommost line (at the
                right border, 16 pixels are missing.....). These are effects of
                switching off the border. Attention!!! I'm now explaining the
                principles of switching off the border:
                <br /><br />
                In the middle of the last line of the normal screen (no. 199
                counted from 0) you must change the syncronization frequency
                from 50Hz to 60Hz. This will cause the Shifter to start the
                right border 16 pixles earlier than usual. Then wait till the
                electron beam is in the left border of the next line. There you
                must switch back from 60Hz to 50Hz and there will be no lower
                border again. The greatest problem is the exact timing of the
                synchronization switching!! Your rout will be disturbed by
                keyboard and timer C interrupts. If you don't succeed in timing
                the program exactly there might be 2 different effects: In the
                easier case you'll see the border again for a moment, in the
                other case you'll see curious things happen on your screen
                (flickering bitplanes and so on). An other result of switching
                off the border is a confused video Shifter which is starting the
                right border 16 pixles too soon as he doesn't want to show the
                last 2 bytes of the video memory. Therefore the first address
                displaid in the first line of the 'border' is 31998 bytes behind
                the first address of the screen !! So you must move your graphix
                2 bytes to the left for not getting 'funny' pictures!
                <br /><br />
                Puh !! Writing this text used much less time than making the
                lousy Psycho-2-Screen for which I needed 48 hours of hard
                programming and i don't know how long ES needed to paint the
                graphix with NEOchrome, the best painting program on the ST!!!
                That's about it, folks! The 99th percent of this scrolling
                message has just ticked away and we're unmistakably nearing the
                100th (and final) percent now.... In a few seconds, the

              <h5>3.2.1.8 Digital Sound Samples</h5>
              <p>
                When you scroll to the very bottom of the music list on the main
                screen of the B.I.G.-Demo, there is a special entry called "The
                Digital Department." Selecting it changes the view, and suddenly
                the Atari ST's speakers produce digital samples of
                near-professional quality with adaptations of even more games.
                The music was close to the capabilities of the Amiga.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here, The Exceptions announced another demo called the
                Amiga-Sound-Demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                After they had adapted nearly all of Rob Hubbard's Commodore 64
                game music, it was now time to start adapting Hubbard's
                Commodore Amiga music. And who else would be capable of such a
                feat if not The Exceptions?
              </p>

              <h5>
                3.2.1.9 The Elements of Design and the Aesthetics of Pixels of
                the B.I.G. Demo
              </h5>
              <p>
                The images produced for the B.I.G.-Demo looked like they
                belonged in a computer or video game, but they were not created
                for that. They were created to stand on their own, to be beheld
                in their own space, all the while in the context of other images
                produced on computers. They were images composed of clearly
                visible and sometimes even distracting building blocks: pixels.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the low-resolution images of the time composed of pixels, the
                pixels themselves did not simply represent a part of the image
                that, together with the other pixels, forms a greater whole: but
                the image as a complete artifact. Pixels were too big, too
                stark, too noticeable for that. Pixels also existed as
                independent entities known as "digital brush strokes," as
                clearly visible building blocks of the entire image. This gives
                each pixel a life of its own, an unapologetic presence, a value
                in and of itself, in addition to the part of the whole picture
                that it represents.
              </p>
              <p>
                This made the pixelated images of this era stand apart from
                paintings, photography, and film frames. Today's displays with a
                greater resolution than the eye can discern can take the shape
                of anything we throw at them. They can "pretend" to show photos
                or reproductions of paintings or videos. The pixelated images of
                the Atari ST and similar computers could not pretend to be
                anything else than what they were. In this way, they truly
                embrace their form.
              </p>

              <h5>3.2.1.10 The Making of the B.I.G.-Demo</h5>
              <p>
                Richard Karsmakers (Cronos), the editor of the diskmag
                <em>ST-NEWS,</em> helped initiate the B.I.G.-Demo and wrote most
                of the record-breaking scrolling text. He had approached The
                Exceptions to motivate them to create the biggest and best demo
                so far. Five months later, they released it on January 24, 1988.
              </p>
              <p>
                Jochen Hippel managed to get the raw data of the original music
                from the Commodore 64 to the Atari ST using a data cable and a
                conversion program supplied by Udo Fischer and Erik Simon.
                However, this does not mean that the music was in any way
                playable or sounded good on the Atari ST. The further manual
                conversion work was time-consuming and required many adaptations
                to the Atari ST's inferior sound chip.
              </p>
              <p>
                The programming of the many Psych-O-Screens required exact
                timing and expert knowledge of the hardware. Together with the
                music, graphics, and digi-sound sample, all the data needed to
                be compressed to a single-sided 3.5" floppy disk so that The
                Exceptions could allow the demo to run on the largest possible
                range of Ataris.
              </p>
              <p>
                Richard Karsmakers continued collaborating with members of The
                Exceptions, who contributed articles, graphics, and music to
                <em>ST-NEWS.</em> Karsmakers also wrote a first-hand account of
                how they finished their next demo, called the Amiga Demo.

              <p>
                The <strong>Amiga Demo</strong> directly targeted the superior
                sound capabilities of the Commodore Amiga by converting tunes
                that were regarded as impossible on the Atari ST's limited sound
                hardware. As if to conquer the last territory of the ST's
                inferiority compared to the Amiga, The Exceptions released the
                Amiga Demo as their last full demo.

                In the Little Sound Demo and Little Color Demo, The Exceptions
                matched the sound generation capabilities of the Commodore 64's
                SID chip. Now, they conjured the same sound quality as the
                mighty Paula chip in the Commodore Amiga from the Atari ST's
                YM-chip. Paula could produce four channels of

                anything at the time, only to be matched on the IBM PC
                compatible with the introduction of the expensive Sound Blaster
                sound card and arguably, by the sound capabilities of the Sega
                MegaDrive/Genesis when it was released in 1988.

              </p>

              <p>
                The Amiga Demo consisted of two screens. The first screen is an
                imitation of a music program on the Commodore Amiga called Aegis
                Sonix, which was a piece of software not written for the Atari
                ST (see <a href="#figure-46">figure 46</a>). It takes advantage
                of the Amiga's sound capabilities and provides users with an
                environment to compose music using notation. The Exceptions did
                not port the actual program onto the ST; rather, they created a
                copy of the file selection screen and a part of the notational
                screen in the background.
              </p>
              <p>
                They ported seven pieces of music from Amiga games, like
                <em>Rally Master,</em> <em>Amegas,</em> and
                <em>Crashin' Robb,</em> for a total of fifteen minutes of
                high-quality, four-voice musical tunes, even though the Atari ST
                is only capable of playing three-voice music. Users can switch
                music by choosing a tune with the cursor keys.

                This digisound was impressive enough, given the ST's sound and
                music limitations, but the most impressive screen is accessed by
                pressing the "O" key (O for overscan). This opens up the
                overscan screen with no lower border and, for the first time on
                the Atari ST, no right border. Removing the right border and
                using the space for graphics was considered impossible. The
                Exceptions had done it.

                The Exceptions not only broke two new limits of the Atari ST by

                but they also managed to break a personal record for the longest

                While the demo-makers were visiting their friend and
                <em>ST-NEWS</em> editor Richard Karsmakers, they wrote the whole
                demo in one continuous hackathon. Karsmakers chronicled the

                They worked on the demo for 22 hours straight, fighting against
                the hardware, using tricks to overcome limitations, and all the
                while eating pizza and drinking soft drinks until most everyone
                fell asleep. Udo Fischer (-ME-) was left to wrap up the
                programming. Karsmakers contributed the contents of the
                scrolling text, Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) managed to faithfully
                convert the Amiga music to the ST's hardware, and Erik Simon
                (ES) created the graphics and the transparent font they needed
                for the demo.

              <h4>3.2.3 Mainstream Exposure</h4>
              <p>
                In 1988, Tarik Ahmia, the editor-in-chief of the established
                mainstream computer magazine
                <em>ST-Magazin 68000er</em> published by
                <em>Markt & Technik</em> in Bavaria, reached out to Udo Fischer,
                Erik Simon, Michael Raasch, and Gunter Bitz. The Exceptions had
                become minor celebrities in the Atari ST demoscene, but they
                were not widely known to the average computer-using audience.
                Tarik Ahmia convinced them to write a series of articles about
                their programming tricks. In five articles in 1988, The
                Exceptions revealed all of their programming secrets to a major
                audience and became widely known outside of the niche of the
                demoscene.<sup

                In photos, they were depicted as silhouettes and marketed as
                secret insiders with only their first names used. This made them
                seem forbidden and taboo, like true hackers. Undoubtedly, it
                contributed to their allure.
              </p>
              <p>
                Their series of articles was called <em>Die Hexer</em> (German
                for "The Wizards" or "The Witchers").

                but it offered several series examining how to produce creative
                work on the Atari ST. Aside from The Exceptions, the magazine
                featured series by commercial artists who produced their own
                magazines using desktop publishing software on the ST, and
                others creating 3D animations for commercial TV stations in
                Germany.

                achievements of the demos. An in-depth analysis would exceed the

                By the late 1980s, computers had become widespread tools in
                corporate administration. They were used for calculations,
                transactions, word processing and other business-related tasks.
                The use of computers as creative tools had been pioneered in the
                1960s and 70s, but only started to break into commercial design
                in the late 1980s. By the time The Exceptions were featured in
                <em>ST Magazin 68000er,</em> the print industry around news
                media and publishing was in the process of transforming to
                digital production. The first Hollywood movies had started to
                feature computer animations. The tools used in the professional
                sector like Linotype page setting systems for page layouts in
                publishing and the Quantel Paintbox for infographics on TV were
                expensive and specialized. Home computer enthusiasts could
                identify that even though these systems were far more advanced
                than their own 16-bit computers, at their core, the expensive
                machines were not that much different than the higher-end home
                computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                By showcasing early hobbyist digital creatives like The
                Exceptions, computer magazines demonstrated the creative
                potential of the machines. They provided instructions on how
                home users could produce their own works and inspire them to
                produce images, music, animations and even demos. Users could
                recognize that the expensive professional computers were much
                more capable, but they could also see that compared to the
                expensive machines, the gap between the capabilities of their
                own computers was closing. A Paintbox sold for $100,000 only
                half a decade earlier could display photorealistic images with
                256 colors from a potential color palette of 16 million. Yet the
                artists used a graphics program on it that resembled the paint
                applications on the Atari ST, the Apple Macintosh and the
                Commodore Amiga. On a $1000 Atari ST, with a lot of effort, home
                users could create their own graphics that came close to the
                professional graphics; they could see the potential lying
                dormant in the technology.
              </p>
              <p>
                By not only reporting <em>about</em> The Exceptions, but by
                having them write a series of articles, The Exceptions explained
                how to produce impressive results with the ST. Computer
                enthusiasts now saw the human beings behind the technology, and
                that The Exceptions were using the same tools available to home
                users. Even though it can be assumed that the editors of the
                magazine revised the articles provided by The Exceptions, there
                is still an endearing awkwardness in the text. Each article
                features a different member explaining their skill; for example,
                explaining how to program smooth scrolling routines, how to
                produce more colors on the screen, how to paint graphics, and
                how to write music. The articles are full of enthusiasm and
                pride at the achievements, yet they are apologetic in their
                descriptions of the solutions because they emphasize that there
                might be better ways to achieve the same results. The articles
                were clearly written by young people who had figured out
                techniques and wrote about them in a language that resonated
                with young readers.
              </p>
              <p>
                By the mid-1980s, only a very few programmers were being
                promoted by name. They were not yet treated like authors of
                books or rock stars. This was the time before John Carmack and
                John Romero, who later became famous for the 3D-shooter
                <em>Doom,</em> and before Shiguro Miyamoto at Nintendo became
                famous. In the United States, there were already a small number
                of famous games developers like Richard Garriott (aka "Lord
                British") who had created the <em>Ultima</em>-Series of
                computer-role-playing-games; Roberta Williams who had written
                <em>King's Quest</em> and many other games at her company
                <em>Sierra On-Line;</em> and Sid Meier who created
                <em>Pirates</em> and had his name put on the box. In the UK, the
                <em>Bitmap Brothers</em> were being promoted by their publisher
                <em>Mirrorsoft</em> like rock stars, using the full public
                relations power of Robert Maxwell's media empire.<sup

                But they all seemed so far away, none of them were from a small
                town in Germany. It was a breakthrough for members of the
                demoscene to be featured in a print magazine.

              <h4>3.2.4 In Conclusion: The Time of Breakthroughs</h4>
              <p>
                This was the year that The Exceptions peaked as demo-makers and
                produced the most demos. Their demos broke numerous hardware
                limitations, like the ST's color limits, the bottom and the
                right screen borders, and the limits of the ST's sound chip with
                their music conversions from other systems like the C64 and the
                Amiga. In the B.I.G-Demo, they produced the longest scrolling
                text to date.
              </p>
              <p>
                It was also the year that The Exceptions started to collaborate
                with others in the demoscene. At first with Alyssa whose
                programming trick for the removal of the bottom border was used
                in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show. Then, in the B.I.G.-Demo, they
                collaborated with the diskmag <em>ST-NEWS</em> for advertising
                and distribution, as well as the diskmag's editor Richard
                Karsmakers for project management and scrolling text.
              </p>
              <p>
                1988 was the year that The Exceptions found recognition outside
                of their small scene by reaching a larger audience in the print
                publication <em>ST-Magazin 68000er,</em> explaining their
                programming tricks. But this was also the year that the main
                members of The Exceptions decided to become legitimate game
                programmers. They would no longer have time to create full
                demos, but the move was necessary for them to make a living from
                their skills.
              </p>
              <p>
                And by 1988, The Exceptions had already inspired so many others
                in the Atari ST demoscene that they had passed the torch onto
                other demo-makers. However, in the next year, The Exceptions
                would still collaborate with others on their mega-demo: the
                biggest demo of all.

              <p>
                The year 1989 was the culmination of the Atari ST demoscene thus
                far. What started out as a single-screen demo with a scrolling
                text now evolved into barnstorming displays of animation,
                multilayered scrolling, color explosions, and 3D graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                No single demo-maker or team could deliver this breadth of
                effects, graphics, and music. It was the
                <strong>Union</strong> of multiple demo-groups, like The
                CareBears, Deltaforce, the TNT-Crew and, of course, The
                Exceptions, that came together to produce two of the best demos
                on the Atari ST in the year. The borders broke. The quest for
                true overscan was finally successful. The whole monitor area now
                became the playground for demos.

              <h4>3.3.1 Union Demo</h4>
              <p>
                January 1989 saw the culmination of the Atari ST demo efforts so
                far. The multiple demo-groups had joined forces to produce the
                Union Demo. The Exceptions teamed up with the TNT Crew, the Care
                Bears, Level 16, the Replicants (a French cracker team), and the
                Delta Force.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <strong>Union Demo</strong> was the first true mega-demo
                that deserved its name. In it, all the limits of the Atari ST
                were broken. In nearly a megabyte of compressed features, each
                demo-group had their own section; users moved a player character
                through a scrolling building to select the different screens,
                acting as an interactive menu.
              </p>
              <p>Marco Breddin described the Union Demo as:</p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Here it is, the computer without custom chips, without sprites,
                without scrolling, without a synthesizer that was built using
                rather too few quality checks but filled with passion, the charm
                and energy of a young computer generation that will give their
                all to break the borders and don't care about system
                specifications."<sup

              <p>
                Six demo-groups worked on the mega-demo:
                <em>The CareBears (TCB),</em> <em>TNT-Crew,</em>
                <em>Delta Force,</em> the <em>Replicants,</em>
                <em>Level 16,</em> and <em>The Exceptions,</em> with eighteen
                contributors to create the thirteen screens of the Union Demo.
                The examination of each dazzling screen starts below.

                The startup screen appears when the demo loads, featuring the
                Union logo and sliding distorted text that moves across a
                vertically scrolling backdrop. The text layout is distorted
                along a wobbly sine curve, with the screen using more than the
                ST's standard 16 colors with music playing in the background.

              <p>
                This screen serves as the menu for the whole demo. It is a
                computer game where users control the character of Charly, an
                aardvark figure that moves across a paved surface that scrolls
                horizontally. The wall behind it has several doors: a door for
                each segment of the demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main area of the screen scrolls smoothly in all directions.
                Users move the character to a door, and then they can enter a
                different section of the demo. Beneath the interactive menu
                area, a smooth horizontal scrolling text moves across the full
                width of the screen using the left and right border. So together
                with the main area and the scrolling text, there are two
                independent scrolling areas. An alien landscape shines through
                the text, scrolling at a different speed than the letters. Of
                course, the screen features more than the standard 16 colors the
                ST can usually display at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                The screen was programmed by Gunter Bitz (6719) of The
                Exceptions, with graphics by Erik Simon (ES). The graphics for
                the character of Charly were drawn by Micky. The scrolling text
                was programmed and written by The CareBears, the left and right
                borders were removed by the TNT-Crew, and Jochen Hippel (Mad
                Max) converted the music, which was composed by Jeroen Tel.

              <p>
                This screen features a vertical background scrolling smoothly
                with a large horizontal text scrolling across the lower part.
                Effectively, this demo screen showed two large scrolling areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scroller at the bottom of the screen features parallax
                scrolling, where both the text and the hi-tech background move
                across the screen, but at different speeds. The graphic shows a
                field of explosions like the pattern of napalm bombing seen from
                afar, and the CareBears have placed the painted words: TCB and
                "Beat 'dis!" across the pattern of explosions and had it scroll
                vertically.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the while, approximately 450KB of digitized, high-quality
                music can be heard. The voice samples "Get down to the funky
                beat" are repeated to a techno beat. Users need an Atari ST with
                at least one megabyte to hear the music. The demo-makers knew
                that in 1989, this was not yet a widespread configuration, so
                machines with less RAM would play chip music by Mad Max instead
                of the sampled sounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                This part of the demo was programmed by Niclas Thissel
                (Nick/Nic) and Jas with graphics by Erik Simon (ES). The font
                was created by Nic using the PC-Font-Maker. The sampled sound
                and music were provided by An Cool. Mad Max programmed the sound
                chip to play the music composed by Fred Gray.

              <p>
                The spherical demo screen by Delta Force is split up into three
                main sections. The top segment shows the logo of Delta Force,
                which rhythmically flips to change to the logo of the Union and
                back again.
              </p>
              <p>
                The section in the center shows a three-dimensional textured
                plane with three bubbles floating above it that pulsate to the
                music corresponding to the Atari ST's three sound channels. The
                bubbles cast shadows on the plane.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bottom part of the screen shows another scrolling text. This
                time, it is distorted along a sine curve as it horizontally
                flows across the screen, and each character's colors fluctuate
                in wave patterns. The text moves back and forth and occasionally
                flips vertically. It was clearly not only created to be read by
                the audience, but also to impress with its transformations. The
                background music was converted from the Commodore 64 game,
                <em>Mega Apocalypse.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                This screen was programmed by New Mode. The graphics were
                provided by Slime and Questlord from Delta Force. The graphics
                for the purple bubbles were created by Erik Simon (ES). The
                music was composed by Rob Hubbard and converted to be playable
                by the ST by Jochen Hippel (Mad Max).

                This screen has some of the first 3D graphics in a demo. In
                front of a starfield in space, fast and solid models are
                spinning across the screen. First, the logo of the TNT-Crew,
                that created this section of the demo, then a simplified version
                of the Union logo. The TNT-Crew had a 3D version of the famous
                Amiga ball, but their version had its center carved out. The
                final two models were a spaceship ripped from the game
                <em>Starglider II</em> and a carrier from
                <em>Carrier Command.</em> The presentation was accompanied by
                chip music, and users could switch between models by pressing
                the key 0 to 5.

              <p>
                The Atari ST had no hardware to support smooth scrolling, but
                the TNT-Crew wanted to prove that it was possible to program a
                smooth horizontal scroller (that had been done before) in
                addition to programming four layers scrolling horizontally at
                independent speeds, simply to outdo their peers.
              </p>
              <p>
                This screen features a slowly moving bubble pattern in the
                background. On top of that, a techno-organic layer scrolls
                across the screen. A green layer in unapologetically shrill
                colors speeds over the two background layers. To top it off, the
                scrolling text dashes over multiple planes. The four-layer
                scrolling is smooth at 50 frames per second. To add a final
                touch, the screen features more than 100 colors and is
                accompanied by digitized music.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a user presses the arrow keys, the scrolling direction of
                the bubbly background layer changes. The smoothness and fluidity
                of the scrolling make this one of the more impressive screens of
                the whole demo.

                Starballs is probably the least impressive screen in the Union
                Demo. It shows a blue space with bubbles shooting towards the
                audience that scale fluently for a fake perspective effect. The
                Union logo hovers transparently on top of the screen while a
                relatively small scrolling text moves across the bottom of the
                screen. Unfortunately, the Starballs screen does not break any
                new ground. The background music was inspired by David Lynch's
                movie, <em>Dune.</em>

                The Wobbly Sprites screen created by the demo-group the
                Replicants shows two scrollers with an alpha effect. In the
                layer under the words "The Union" at the top and the bottom of
                the screen, just peeking in between the contours, two scrolling
                texts rush by that can only be read if you really focus on them.
                Thirteen sprites forming the name of the demo-group dance along
                sine waves and wobble across the screen. Six raster color bars
                move up and down at different speeds.

                This was the very first time that the Atari ST could be coerced
                into using the full display and remain stable while doing so.
                The demo-makers group Level 16 perfected programming the
                electron beam to achieve this; the Atari ST's whole screen was
                now a stage for demos.<sup

              </p>
              <p>
                The top of the screen shows an abstract landscape framed by what
                looks like brains. In the center, the sun is setting to a raster
                horizon with dozens of colors. The handles of the demo-makers
                are scattered across the golden plane.
              </p>
              <p>
                The centerpiece is the Level 16 logo. A pipe runs through it
                from the right side of the screen, where the ST usually shows a
                border, across and behind the logo to the left side. In an
                allusion to a simple Rube Goldberg machine, the pipe spews blue
                liquid into a funnel, exactly where the left border should be
                visible. The base of the logo sports a simplified cityscape with
                letters spelling out "Worldwide" beneath it.
              </p>
              <p>
                A pool of blue liquid with two splashes and the ever-present
                bubbles occupies the lower part of the screen. The whole screen
                is constantly traversed by a sprite in the shape of the Union's
                letter "U," moving into and out of areas that were previously
                reserved for the ST's screen borders, proving that this limit
                had now been broken.
              </p>
              <p>
                How did the demo-makers conquer the whole screen? The screen
                height is about 412 lines, and the Atari's hardware counts each
                scanline so that it knows which line the monitor's beam is
                drawing at each moment. When the line has drawn the left border,
                the Atari ST starts to top draw the actual graphics; it stops
                drawing graphics at the right border. When the beam reaches
                bottom line of the screen, the ST stops drawing graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Atari ST could work using the North American NTSC standard
                and the European PAL standard. On a US monitor, the ST would
                switch its display to 60 Hz to display 60 pictures per second
                with a slightly smaller main area; on a European monitor, the ST
                would display 50 pictures per second with a larger main area.
              </p>
              <p>
                The demo-makers at Level 16 realized that if they switched the
                computer from the European display frequency to the North
                American display frequency at just the right point, they could
                fool the hardware into continuing to draw into the border. This
                required very precise coordination of each instruction and
                knowing the exact position of the monitor's beam at any time so
                that the demo could switch frequency at the right point. To use
                the left border, the ST was forced to switch to the 71Hz
                frequency of the monochrome resolution for a split second to
                confuse the display hardware. This pulsating distortion of the
                machine's synapses allowed the ST to use the full screen. It
                became a carefully coordinated clockwork of colors and
                coordinates.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Atari ST was complex enough to be powerful, but still simple
                enough that a person could understand every aspect of its
                hardware to hack it. And Level 16 hacked it to do exactly what
                they wanted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The screen was programmed by Ilja from Level 16 with graphics by
                Don from Level 16 and Erik Simon (ES) from The Exceptions. The
                music featured on this screen is an original composition by Mad
                Max.

                While Level 16's fullscreen part of the Union Demo may
                technically be the most impressive section, the third scroller
                by The CareBears is not only technically impressive, but also
                aesthetically spectacular.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CareBears created a multilayered scrolling screen. The top
                and bottom parts of the screen have about a dozen layers
                smoothly scrolling by at different speeds to create a parallax
                effect and a feeling of perspective depth. Like the warming
                inevitability of a summer's breeze, the multiple planes speed
                across the screen as smoothly and as fluently as a lover's
                pounding heart.

              <p>
                In the center of the screen, The CareBears logo becomes
                algorithmically distorted and mathematically flipped while
                pounding digi-techno plays. The fonts are metallic and inspired
                by the "heavy metal" aesthetic. They were, at the same time,
                cheap and glossy, inspired by computer games.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over and across the whole screen, a sine wave of text whips
                across, moving in and out of the top and bottom sections. And
                all of this with hundreds of colors on the screen at the same
                time (see <a href="#figure-66">figure 66</a>).

              <p>
                The total size of all the data of all the screens of the Union
                Demo was 1400KB, and the Exceptions helped find a way to
                compress all of this to 900KB. Udo Fischer (-ME-) programmed
                compression routines that unpacked the required parts of the
                demo when a user accessed one of the screens. The Union Demo
                came on a double-sided, 3.5" floppy disk that only fit 720KB.
                But The Exceptions came up with an extended disk format to fit
                the full 900KB of crunched code, graphics, and music (for more
                details on disk formats and how to archive them, please see
                Appendix I).
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, this meant that the disk could not be copied the
                regular way using the Atari ST's operating system. Therefore,
                The Exceptions devised a copying program as part of the demo
                itself, which enabled users to make as many copies of the Union

                advantage of the extended disk format. Naturally, The Exceptions

                (ES), music composed by Jeroen Tel, and sound adaptation by Mad

              <p>
                The Union Demo has a hidden screen that can be accessed by
                moving the Charly character on the menu screen to one of the
                plants. Users are presented with the ST Soundtracker Sample-Mon,
                a music player that can reproduce the high-quality four-voice
                music from the Amiga on the ST's three-voice sound chip. When
                moving the mouse, the mouse pointer is replaced by computer
                game-like sprites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Soundtracker was programmed by Gunther Bitz (6719). With
                graphics by Hexagon and mouse sprite graphics by Erik Simon
                (ES), it features an original composition by Mad Max.

              <h5>3.3.1.14 Breaking the Atari ST's Limitations</h5>
              <p>
                The Atari ST started out as the underdog of the 16-bit computer
                generation. It was affordable, but the hardware was rushed to
                market. The rushed hardware led to limitations on the number of
                colors on screen, big screen borders, no dedicated graphics
                chips for scrolling, no hardware support for sprites, and a
                sound chip that was used in 8-bit computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Union Demo broke all these limitations. All the demo screens
                showcased dozens of colors that far surpassed the ST's standard
                16 color limitation. The fullscreen section by Level 16 removed
                all the borders and used them to display graphics. The CareBears
                (TCB) and the TNT-Crew created super-smooth multidirectional
                scrollers, and in some cases, multiple scrollers on the same
                screen moving horizontally and vertically. The Replicants had
                more than a dozen sprites whizzing around fluidly. And the
                limitations of the ST's AY/YM sound chip was blown away by Mad
                Max, who managed to tickle music worthy of a Commodore Amiga out
                of the archaic sound hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                As The CareBears (TCB) adequately put it in their Wow!
                Superscroller: "The Union needs no custom chips." Where the
                hardware left them wanting, the demo-makers made up for it in
                their ingenuity for programming the software.

                Stefan Posthuma, a demo-maker known as Digital Insanity from the
                demo-group The Lost Boys, wrote about the Union Demo in his
                "History of Demo Programming on the ST" in the diskmag

                something never to be equalled. Well, in a sense this is true.
                'The Union Demo' is a true classic, making a heavy impact on the
                demo world. 'The Union Demo' contained a few screens by The
                CareBears, including the 3D-sinus-and-a-whollottamore-stuff (or
                something) scroller which is considered by most people to be the
                best demo screen ever written. With their screens The CareBears
                established themselves once and forever and their coder Nic
                (Niclas Thissel) was to become a living legend afterwards."

                The Exceptions might have pioneered the Atari ST demoscene, but
                to create the Union Demo, six disparate groups from all over
                Europe came together to create thirteen demo screens: Niclas
                Thissel (Nic), Jas, Micky, and An Cool from The CareBears (TCB),
                New Mode, Slime and Questlord from Delta Force, Hexadez, Jojo,
                and Hexogen (Michael Bittner) from the TNT-Crew, Excalibur and
                Rank Xerox from The Replicants, Ilja and Don from Level 16, Erik
                Simon (ES), Jochen Hippel (Mad Max), Gunter Bitz (6719), and Udo
                Fischer (-ME-) from The Exceptions (TEX).

                The knowledge, abilities, and powers of these eighteen
                individuals contributed to the technical masterpiece that
                surpassed all restrictions of the ST; now, the Atari's demoscene
                was alight with ideas and innovation.

                The Union Demo was not only the swan song of The Exceptions as
                demo-makers; 1989 was the last year that The Exceptions spent
                any substantial amount of time on creating demo art. They moved
                on to game development and founded Thalion, together with other
                key players in the ST demo scene, including members of the
                TNT-Crew, The CareBears (TCB), and DeltaForce. They would spend
                the rest of 1989 working on their game releases. Meanwhile,
                other demo-groups from all over Europe saw what could be done
                with the Atari ST. The game was on.

                In 1989, The CareBears from Sweden released their impressive
                Swedish New Year Demo, and not to be outdone by their
                competition in the scene, they followed that with the Cuddly
                Demo and the Whattaheck Demo in the same year.

                Thalion Software, the new home of The Exceptions in Gütersloh,
                Northrhine-Westphalia in West Germany, started to release games
                for the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga. Among their first
                releases included the beat-em'-up game
                <em>Chambers of Shaolin,</em> the space shooter
                <em>Warp,</em> the jump-and-run
                <em>Seven Gates of Jamabala,</em> the shoot-'em-up
                <em>Leavin' Teramis,</em> and the puzzle game
                <em>Atomix.</em> They were technically sophisticated games with
                intricate graphics, smooth scrolling, and superior sound and
                music. Most were met with rave reviews and sold well in the
                market.

                The crowning achievement of Thalion was the game that The
                Exceptions had started working on right after the B.I.G. Demo, a
                fantasy role-playing game called <em>Dragonflight.</em> They
                worked on the game until they achieved the level of perfection
                they wanted, and it was released in 1990.
                <em>Dragonflight</em> was based on an original story by Erik
                Simon, who also produced the graphics, while Udo Fischer
                programmed the game, and Jochen Hippel composed the music. The
                <em>ST-NEWS</em> veteran Richard Karsmakers wrote the novella
                that came as part of the package. The game was well-received and
                spawned two sequels.

                scrolling shoot-'em-up game. In both <em>Wings of Death</em> and
                in <em>Dragonflight,</em> there is a red dragon like the one we

                The Exceptions had made it. Their dreams had come true; they
                evolved from basement-coders who created colorful demos into
                inspirational figures in demo art. They united the demoscene to
                make something spectacular and went on to become hard-working
                professionals in the bludgeoning games industry of the 1990s.

                The Exceptions were not the best overall on the Atari ST, but
                they were the first, and therefore laid the groundwork for the
                best to come. Together with their fellow demo-makers, they
                learned their trade on a marginal computer with limited
                hardware. With their inquisitiveness and ingenuity, they managed
                to expose the last bits of performance out of the Atari ST and
                create demos that broke the last technical limits. While doing
                so, they created demo art and contributed to spawning a thriving
                scene on that system.

                By leading the way, provoking their competitors, and showing

                age. Then, they used their skills, discipline, and dedication to
                become game developers. The Exceptions changed the demoscene
                taking it from a basement hobby to a much larger phenomenon and
                lived to pursue their aspirations in the process.

                3.5 Computing Since the Days of The Exceptions
              </h3>
              <p>
                What has happened in computing since The Exceptions? In short,
                essentially everything we know today. Since 1989, there has been
                the success of Microsoft Windows, the unstoppable expansion of
                the world wide web, mobile computing and smartphones, machine
                learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain and
                crypto-currencies, and a games industry with a larger total
                revenue than the movie business.<sup

              </p>
              <p>
                Software development has changed too. The Exceptions, other
                demo-makers, and game creators used to write software for
                specific machines in assembly language. Most software today is
                written for platforms, such as the web, specific desktop
                operating systems like Windows or MacOS, smartphone platforms
                like Android or iOS, or gaming consoles like the Nintendo
                Switch, the Microsoft Xbox, or the Sony PlayStation. To
                summarize it all in a few paragraphs would be an exercise in
                futility; yet there are some key developments that need to be
                pointed out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some platforms transcend the hardware and can run on any
                sufficiently powerful system. The first of these is the web
                itself. Web browsers have turned into their own computing
                platform that opens a pressure valve into the information super
                stream and allows copious amounts of data to flow into it. The
                operating system of a device provides multiple layers, such as
                low-level functions and drivers, application programming
                interfaces and libraries, and finally, the user interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, third party software run their frameworks and
                engines, i.e., large collections of proven tools that enable
                more and more complex software projects and take away the need
                to develop common features every time from scratch. These
                include web frameworks, but also gaming engines like Unity and
                the Unreal Engine. Game engines are whole systems for creating
                everything a game needs, such as the game logic and the rules,
                the 3D worlds and the characters, the animation, and all the
                interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past thirty years, game development has moved from 2D
                to 3D, and at the same time, has become less dependent on the
                actual hardware and more dependent on the frameworks and
                engines. Games developers very rarely go right "to the metal";
                they do not program at the very basic hardware level, but
                instead use frameworks or ideally a game engine like Unity or
                the Unreal Engine that run on the major computing and gaming
                platforms and is therefore independent of the actual hardware.
                On the other hand, games and 3D creation demand a high computing
                performance and are dependent on fast CPUs and powerful graphics
                cards, so that they can produce newer, more elaborate, and
                flashy games to draw in the gamers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The wide variety of different home computers in the 1980s has
                disappeared today. Personal computers have settled on the
                commercial duopoly of the OS Microsoft Windows and the single
                manufacturer operating system of Apple's MacOS, with a
                consistent market share that hovers at ten percent. A multitude
                of Linux distributions compete for the desktops and notebooks of
                end users. Even though the global annual adoption of Linux
                seldom exceeds single digits percentages, in the background,
                most of the internet runs on Linux servers. Most commercial
                applications have an open-source equivalent, created, and
                maintained by large groups of enthusiasts who pore in their time
                and ingenuity. They have found an unlikely alliance with large
                corporations and public entities like governments, universities
                and municipalities that sponsor and help develop open-source
                software for their own benefit, and the benefit of all. For
                example, every dollar a large company like Novell spends on
                LibreOffice<sup

                The demoscene thrives to this day as a tiny corner of the
                open-source world and a niche of new media art. Members of the
                demoscene still create their art and participate in demo-parties
                and competitions. The computing performance available to users
                today is so vast that the demoscenes implement artificial
                limitations. They might be memory limitations, e.g., a full demo
                in 64Kbytes, or time limitations, e.g., to develop a demo in a
                48-hour hackathon, or use old computing hardware that is far
                less capable than the hardware today to prove that in the hands
                of the right developers, it is far more capable than anyone
                would have thought.

                And decades ago, on one of these obsolete computers, the Atari
                ST, The Exceptions were "ground zero" for their field of the
                demoscene.

                Two years after the release of the ST, the Atari Corporation
                introduced a Blitter chip (Bit-Block Transfer Processor) for
                their computer that enabled it to shift larger amounts of
                graphics data smoothly. It was an optional add-on that did not
                catch on in gaming and only started to be used extensively with
                the introduction of the enhanced Atari STE that came with the
                Blitter built in by default.<br /><a

                As was customary in the 1980s, applications were distributed as
                actual type-in program listings that users would type into their
                machines. In the late 1980s, magazines started to provide

                The very first demo that proved that the ST could be made to
                display the full screen was the aptly named Fullscreen Demo by
                the Flying Egg/Omega. Unfortunately, it was unstable and only
