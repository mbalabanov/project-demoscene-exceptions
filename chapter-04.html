              After 1987, other demo-groups started to form and release their
              demos. Many came from the cracker scene, pirating games, and now
              creating demos. The Exceptions started to attract the attention
              of computer magazines, exposing them to a greater readership.
              They published a series in a commercial print magazine, and they
              worked on their first commercial computer game. Even though it
              looked like they were leaving the demoscene, they wanted to go
              out with a bang. And what a bang it was'; one might even refer
              to it as a B.I.G. bang!

            <p>
              The <strong>B.I.G. Demo</strong> called itself the "Best In
              Galaxy" demo and represented the culmination of The Exceptions'
              work up to this point. It included more than 100 tunes converted
              from the Commodore 64, displayed an increased number of colors,
              and the lower screen border removed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Udo Fischer (-ME-), Erik Simon (ES), and Jochen Hippel (Mad Max)
              were now joined by Michael Raasch (Daryl) and Gunter Bitz (6719)
              to create the first megademo by a single demo-group.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-50" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-50">[50]</a></sup>
              The whole B.I.G. demo ran on a 512KB machine and was stored on
              one single-sided disk, which had a capacity of 360KB.
            </p>
            <p>
              It featured 113 music tunes, three so-called "Psych-O-Screens"
              with the latest effects and a screen with the longest text
              scroller ever packed into a demo so far. In addition, when you
              pressed the reset button on the computer, you would get a hidden
              custom reset screen.
            </p>

            <h4>4.1.1 Main Screen</h4>
            <p>
              The main screen showed a selection of all the 113 music tunes
              converted at an even higher fidelity from games on the Commodore
              64 than in the Little Sound Demo and the Little Color Demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              Users navigated the song list using the cursor keys. By hitting
              "1," "2," or "3," they changed to the Psych-O-Screens and "B"
              would open the B.I.G.-Scroller.
            </p>

            <p class="text-center" id="circuits-ablaze-figure-36">
              <img src="img/picture37.webp" alt="Figure 36" class="img-fluid" />
            </p>

              Figure 36: The main screen of the B.I.G.-Demo (screenshot)
            </p>

            <p>
              If you listened to all the music, it would take more than four
              hours, with tunes that range from happy to melancholic, from pop
              to rock. Some of the 113 games on the Commodore 64 are
              <em>Sanxion,</em> <em>Lightforce,</em>
              <em>Master of Magic,</em> <em>Monty On The Run,</em>
              <em>Crazy Comets,</em> <em>Thing On A Spring,</em> and
              <em>Auf Wiedersehen Monty</em> (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-36">figure 36</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              The scrolling text occupied the bottom part of the screen in the
              lower border. Erik Simon (ES) used a similarly shaped font to
              the Super-Neo-Demo-Show, except that in the B.I.G.-Demo, it was
              much more colorful. It looked like it was embossed in the gray
              background with multicolored highlights running diagonally
              across each letter.
            </p>
            <p>
              As can be seen in the screenshot above, a horizontal tubular
              gradient bar starts within the left border, crosses the main
              display area, and extends into the right border. At the bottom
              of the screen, the shadow covers part of the scrolling text.
              Both the shadow and the bar were achieved by changing the
              palette registers of the border color, making it look like the
              main contents extend across the left and right. Beneath the
              scroller, even further into the lower border, the top half of
              the logo of TEX protrudes into the screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first and main screen of the B.I.G.-Demo is gray with some
              multicolored highlights. While not exactly the most exciting
              screen, it is well balanced compared to the previous two demos.
              It provides instructions to change the music and to switch to
              the impressive parts of the demo: the insanely technicolored
              Psycho-O-Screens.

            <p>
              In the center of the screen, a gray cube with The Exceptions'
              logo floats in a sea of static (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-37">figure 37</a>). A bar of
              rainbow colors as wide as the full screen with borders moves up
              and down. When the bar reaches the cube, it stretches behind the
              logo, but in front of the front-facing surface of the cube. At
              the same time, the bar protrudes behind the cube's sides,
              something that, according to all laws of perspective, should in
              fact be displayed behind the bar. This Esherian contraption is
              emphasized by the patterned frame of colors of a single tone
              that encase it, though the multicolor bar pierces it. All the
              while the colors of the frame pulsate in different colors fading
              in and out of multiple palettes of related shades (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-38">figures 38</a> and

              Beneath the frame in the area of the screen's lower border, The
              Exceptions repeat their trick with graphics in the overscan area
              by painting in dozens of bright and contrasting colors the words
              "Colorright by," then a gray tubular representation of their TEX
              logo.

            <p>
              This screen shows a platform of a hundred colors floating in the
              blackness of space. On it, different-sized gray spheres cast
              shadows. Rectangular structures lie between the spheres; in the
              negative space of the shadows the rectangles cast, you can see
              the initials ES for the artist Erik Simon, the word TEX for The
              Exceptions, and the two connected musical notes for the music
              from the home screen that continues to play.

            <p>
              The surreal "Daliism" of this floating island does not remain
              alone for long. Starting from the left, multicolored scanlines
              start to fill the black background with vivid radiance until the
              whole width of the screen is covered (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-40">figure 40</a>). Beneath it
              all, a gray fish inexplicably hovers in the Atari ST's lower
              border.
            </p>
            <p>
              Only now, as the screen is full of interrupted scanlines of
              vibrance, can we see a handful of spherical silhouettes right
              next to the fish. Perhaps these are technicolor bubbles leaving
              the fish's mouth (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-41">figure 41</a>).

              On the second Psych-O-Screen, The Exceptions outdo themselves in
              the multitude of colors on the screen at the same time; a number
              close to the full available spectrum of the Atari ST's 512
              colors. Surreal shapes in color space are the theme of this
              image, therefore it makes perfect sense that The Exceptions
              whimsically post the following text above their epic sea of
              luminance:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "We hope they never find the corpse of this guy who said, we

            <p>
              If one could call the previous Psych-O-Screen merely colorful,
              then this third screen explodes with surreal colors like a
              digital Jackson Pollock on LSD. The Exceptions push the color
              limits and use as much of the borders as possible. Despite what
              the other screens showed, they had not yet managed to draw
              actual graphics into the side borders. Thus far, they could only
              produce straight horizontal lines in the left and right overscan
              area. These techniques fill the whole Psych-O-Screen (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-42">figure 42</a>).

            <p>
              They created a Psych-O-Screen with hundreds of interleaved lines
              of colors horizontally stacked onto the screen. These lines
              extended into all the borders, except for the top border. This
              was the closest to full overscan that the Atari ST had achieved
              so far.

            <p>
              For the final trick, The Exceptions also included a reset
              screen. When the user pressed the reset button on their Atari
              ST, the computer did not reboot as it should by default. Showing
              a bomb on the screen was the standard way the Atari ST's
              operating system to report a system crash, an error, or an
              <em>exception.</em> But in this case, the bomb started to
              multiply and turn into a cartoon version of the system icon. The
              Exceptions had caught the reset command and created a mock

            <h4>4.1.7 A Reading of the Scrolling Text</h4>
            <p>
              In this section, the focus will be on the examination of the
              scrolling text. It is the longest scrolling text in any of their
              demos up to this point, and therefore provides insights into the
              self-proclaimed intentions and thinking of the demo-makers. From
              the onset, it should be established that the majority of the
              text was not produced by the core members of the Exceptions, but
              rather by Richard Karsmakers (Cronos from the Amazing Cracking
              Conspiracy)<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-53" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-53">[53]</a></sup>, the editor of the diskmag <em>ST-NEWS</em> who helped the
              demo-makers start on this demo effort and distributed and
              advertised the demo once it was completed. That being said, the
              demo itself is the work of The Exceptions. They would not allow
              the text to contain anything that contradicts their intentions
              and thinking. The scrolling is summarized below.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the introduction, with a description of the contents and
              features of the demo, the writer states the playtime of all the
              music combined and the length of the scrolling text. Then, the
              writer praises the contributors of the music, the code, the
              graphics, and himself before decrying the Atari ST's YM-2149
              sound chip and graphics hardware. The next section is a list of
              credits for the demo's contributors. This is followed by a list
              of the records broken by the demo, which include the number of
              pieces of music, their total length, the length of the scrolling
              message, and the admirable achievement of compressing it all to
              a single-sided floppy disk.
            </p>
            <p>
              The longest section is the greetings to other members of the
              scene. They range from members of the Atari ST demoscene,
              demo-makers on other systems, developers of commercial software
              on the ST, as well as people at the Atari Corporation who helped
              develop the machine. The language tropes used are playful
              insults, boasts, and other competitive linguistic forms to
              create sociality in the burgeoning demoscene on the Atari ST.
              Some of the greetings have playful remarks, such as "Amiga
              Software Syndicate (though they are working on the wrong
              machine)." While not explicitly stated, there are only men on
              the list.
            </p>
            <p>
              Three of the "greetings" were disrespectful messages directed at
              groups whom The Exceptions despised for acting dishonorably: the
              cracking groups <em>HSS</em> that distributed programs that were
              not copy-protected by their publishers (but HSS credited
              themselves as having cracked the copy protection). the cracker
              group named <em>Klu Klux Clan Conspiracy</em> in bad taste, and
              <em>Strike Force.</em> Both wrongfully credited themselves with
              the cracks done by others:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              "HSS (the biggest cocksucker around, that always puts his name
              in programs that others cracked, writes 'cracked by' in loading
              pictures of non-protected software, and that has to watch his
              steps before someone will punch his bleedin' nose)
              <br /><br />
              Klu Klux Clan Conspiracy (another one of those queers, writing
              his name in some DMA crackings)

              Strike Force (a bunch a half-ass fags that put smart-ass intros
              in front of programs they didn't even crack - using routines
              they pinched from others)."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Richard Karsmakers and The Exceptions use strong language in
              this section. It is not only offensive, but also sexually
              violent and homophobic and departs in tone from the other
              sections. This strong language was deliberately chosen to attack
              the cracker groups. These paragraphs provide an insight into the
              unspoken "codex" of the scene, where claiming merits is the
              primary currency. Wrongfully claiming credit is regarded as a
              violation of this codex. The Exceptions express their anger and
              dissatisfaction with these groups who acted dishonorably.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writers are not native English-speakers. Derogatory
              vernacular in the 1980s was pejoratively directed at sexuality
              as offensive slurs. From a modern perspective, this is not
              acceptable and does not conform to our present-day cultural
              norms nor political correctness. In the context of the times and
              hyper-masculine action movies of the 1980s as watched by this
              generation of young men, the choice of words is offensive, but
              not unusual.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the next section, there is an interesting duality. Richard
              Karsmakers' demoscene handle is Cronos, he is part of the
              <em>Amazing Cracking Conspiracy (ACC),</em> and he works on
              ST-NEWS under his real name, yet in this text, he uses his scene
              handle. To create distance between his civilian identity and his
              scene identity, he praises the work of ST-NEWS as though he is
              not a contributor:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "Amazing Cracking Conspiracy ('ST NEWS' is a great magazine!
              read more about it further in this scrolling message. Give our
              love to Willeke!)"
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              There is a mildly profane message to the
              <em>"motherfucker that brought the virus on the ST."</em>
              Karsmakers elaborates that
              <em>"words fail to tell what we think of him, but I can assure
                you it ain't much good."</em>
              This was the age when viruses were distributed through infected
              floppy disks, and in some cases, as infected files in a Bulletin
              Board System (BBS). Getting a virus into circulation in this way
              was a very deliberate act. Karsmakers closes with a humorous
              death curse to the virus maker
              <em>("...may thunder and lightning split your dim-witted skulls
                into a thousand tiny fragments…").</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              The next section lists metrics related to the creation of the
              demo, e.g., the number of developer hours that went into the
              development (2,019 hours), the number of bottles of soft drinks,
              beer, and wine, as well as the cups of tea and coffee that they
              drank during this time. The metrics go on to list materials used
              like diskettes, adhesive strips, paper, and other materials.
              They list all the computers they used. Oddly enough, this
              includes not only the Atari and Commodore 64, but also a
              Commodore Amiga and an Apple Macintosh II (which at the time was
              prohibitively expensive). They praise the applications they
              used, which includes another praise for the pixel-paint
              application NEOchrome.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is a tidbit alluding to the demo-makers having to neglect
              their schoolwork due to working on their demo:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "82 hours spent cleaning the schoolyard (due to arriving too
              late at school or not properly attending the lessons while
              developing a piece of the demo on chemistry notepaper)."
            </blockquote>
            <p>A long section is dedicated to game musician Rob Hubbard:</p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "To fill this scrolling text with more or less useful things, I
              think it is more than appropriate to write something about the
              man to whom this demo program is dedicated: Rob Hubbard (music
              programmer on various computer systems amongst which are
              Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga and Atari ST)."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Below, Karsmakers describes the games that feature Hubbard's
              music and how Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) converted the tunes to the
              ST. Under his pseudonym, Karsmakers advertises his own diskmag
              ST-NEWS:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">

              published through Richard of the ACC as a public domain
              offering."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Again, Richard Karsmakers (Cronos) references himself as a
              different person.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writer is still trying to make the text longer, so he starts
              a joke section where he quotes the first joke ever in a
              scrolling message on the Commodore 64 ("Biggles" by FBG):
              <em>"What does an elephant use as a tampon? [...] it's a
                sheep!"</em>
              An unfunny and mildly offensive joke.
            </p>
            <p>
              What follows is the "obligatory" Amiga vs. ST section. The
              competition between platforms has been a motivating factor for
              the demo-makers on the ST since the very beginning:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "Now, many Atari ST users start throwing up when they hear
              someone mentioning the Amiga, and nearly all Amiga users truly
              think the Atari ST is a heap of shit (and the worst thing is
              that they really think it is a heap of shit, whereas Atari ST
              users just talk negatively about the Amiga for jealousy
              reasons). That jealousy, by the way, grows less and less by the
              day because demo programs like this start appearing on the ST,
              together with more and more excellent games and other programs."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This section evokes the inherent technological tribalism of the
              demoscene. It specifically addresses the envy that owners of the
              Atari ST feel toward the Amiga's superior capabilities. The text
              states that Amiga owners look down on the ST for being the
              inferior machine. Certainly, some Amiga owners and demo-makers
              held the Atari ST and, by extension, its owners in contempt, but
              this was not as widespread an opinion in the Amiga demoscene.
              Many ST demos poked at the Amiga, yet very few Amiga demos
              attacked the ST.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next section was a useful set of instructions on how to wire
              the ST's monitor port to an amplifier for stereo sound. This was
              followed very late in the scrolling text by the instructions on
              how to use the B.I.G. Demo, how to access the different
              Psych-O-Screens, and how to change the music. To be fair, the
              abbreviated instructions are also listed on the main screen.
            </p>
            <p>
              The writers then describe the distribution model of the demo.
              This is generally how most demos on most computer systems were
              distributed: freely and as part of the "public domain" software
              scene. This is not the same legal term for intellectual property
              that is no longer copyrighted, but a by-now-extinct model of
              software distribution where public domain software libraries
              would distribute software that had explicitly been made
              available by its creators. Usually, the only costs that could be
              charged were for the disk and the effort to make the copy,
              therefore they remained affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is striking that The Exceptions urge for the free and wide
              distribution of their demo in this section. They also ask for
              donations. This is in 1988, nearly a decade before the
              prevalence of the free and open-source software movement.

              It takes several hours for the full text to scroll by. If you
              read it on the screen while it scrolls, you would have a good
              amount of ghosting in your eyes by the end. Even after averting

              border again. The greatest problem is the exact timing of the
              synchronization switching!! Your rout will be disturbed by
              keyboard and timer C interrupts. If you don't succeed in timing
              the program exactly there might be 2 different effects: In the
              easier case you'll see the border again for a moment, in the
              other case you'll see curious things happen on your screen
              (flickering bitplanes and so on). An other result of switching
              off the border is a confused video Shifter which is starting the
              right border 16 pixles too soon as he doesn't want to show the
              last 2 bytes of the video memory. Therefore the first address
              displaid in the first line of the 'border' is 31998 bytes behind
              the first address of the screen !! So you must move your graphix
              2 bytes to the left for not getting 'funny' pictures!
              <br /><br />
              Puh !! Writing this text used much less time than making the
              lousy Psycho-2-Screen for which I needed 48 hours of hard
              programming and i don't know how long ES needed to paint the
              graphix with NEOchrome, the best painting program on the ST!!!
              That's about it, folks! The 99th percent of this scrolling
              message has just ticked away and we're unmistakably nearing the
              100th (and final) percent now.... In a few seconds, the
              scrolling message will start anew.... Au revoir auf wiedersehen
              tot ziens arrividerci tschuess good bye houdoe doeg see you
              later, alligator .....Anyway, we hope to see you again in the
              next TEX demo (if one should be made sometimes).

            <h4>4.1.8 Digital Sound Samples</h4>
            <p>
              When you scroll to the very bottom of the music list on the main
              screen of the B.I.G.-Demo, there is a special entry called "The
              Digital Department." Selecting it changes the view, and suddenly
              the Atari ST's speakers produce digital samples of
              near-professional quality with adaptations of even more games.
              The music was close to the capabilities of the Amiga.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here, The Exceptions announced another demo called the
              Amiga-Sound-Demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              After they had adapted nearly all of Rob Hubbard's Commodore 64
              game music, it was now time to start adapting Hubbard's
              Commodore Amiga music. And who else would be capable of such a
              feat if not The Exceptions?
            </p>

            <h4>
              4.1.9 The Elements of Design and the Aesthetics of Pixels of the
              B.I.G. Demo
            </h4>
            <p>
              The images produced for the B.I.G.-Demo looked like they
              belonged in a computer or video game, but they were not created
              for that. They were created to stand on their own, to be beheld
              in their own space, all the while in the context of other images
              produced on computers. They were images composed of clearly
              visible and sometimes even distracting building blocks: pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the low-resolution images of the time composed of pixels, the
              pixels themselves did not simply represent a part of the image
              that, together with the other pixels, forms a greater whole: but
              the image as a complete artifact. Pixels were too big, too
              stark, too noticeable for that. Pixels also existed as
              independent entities known as "digital brush strokes," as
              clearly visible building blocks of the entire image. This gives
              each pixel a life of its own, an unapologetic presence, a value
              in and of itself, in addition to the part of the whole picture
              that it represents.
            </p>
            <p>
              This made the pixelated images of this era stand apart from
              paintings, photography, and film frames. Today's displays with a
              greater resolution than the eye can discern can take the shape
              of anything we throw at them. They can "pretend" to show photos
              or reproductions of paintings or videos. The pixelated images of
              the Atari ST and similar computers could not pretend to be
              anything else than what they were. In this way, they truly
              embrace their form.
            </p>

            <h4>4.1.10 The Making of the B.I.G.-Demo</h4>
            <p>
              Richard Karsmakers (Cronos), the editor of the diskmag
              <em>ST-NEWS,</em> helped initiate the B.I.G.-Demo and wrote most
              of the record-breaking scrolling text. He had approached The
              Exceptions to motivate them to create the biggest and best demo
              so far. Five months later, they released it on January 24, 1988.
            </p>
            <p>
              Jochen Hippel managed to get the raw data of the original music
              from the Commodore 64 to the Atari ST using a data cable and a
              conversion program supplied by Udo Fischer and Erik Simon.
              However, this does not mean that the music was in any way
              playable or sounded good on the Atari ST. The further manual
              conversion work was time-consuming and required many adaptations
              to the Atari ST's inferior sound chip.
            </p>
            <p>
              The programming of the many Psych-O-Screens required exact
              timing and expert knowledge of the hardware. Together with the
              music, graphics, and digi-sound sample, all the data needed to
              be compressed to a single-sided 3.5" floppy disk so that The
              Exceptions could allow the demo to run on the largest possible
              range of Ataris.
            </p>
            <p>
              Richard Karsmakers continued collaborating with members of The
              Exceptions, who contributed articles, graphics, and music to
              <em>ST-NEWS.</em> Karsmakers also wrote a first-hand account of
              how they finished their next demo, called the Amiga Demo.

            <p>
              The <strong>Amiga Demo</strong> directly targeted the superior
              sound capabilities of the Commodore Amiga by converting tunes
              that were regarded as impossible on the Atari ST's limited sound
              hardware. As if to conquer the last territory of the ST's
              inferiority compared to the Amiga, The Exceptions released the
              Amiga Demo as their last full demo.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the Little Sound Demo and Little Color Demo, The Exceptions
              matched the sound generation capabilities of the Commodore 64's
              SID chip. Now, they conjured the same sound quality as the
              mighty Paula chip in the Commodore Amiga from the Atari ST's
              YM-chip. Paula could produce four channels of
              <sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-55" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-55">[55]</a></sup>
              sample-based digital sound. Technically, it was ahead of
              anything at the time, only to be matched on the IBM PC
              compatible with the introduction of the expensive Sound Blaster
              sound card and arguably, by the sound capabilities of the Sega
              MegaDrive/Genesis when it was released in 1988.

              Figure 46: The music demo screen of the Amiga Demo (screenshot)
            </p>

            <p>
              The Amiga Demo consisted of two screens. The first screen is an
              imitation of a music program on the Commodore Amiga called Aegis
              Sonix, which was a piece of software not written for the Atari
              ST (see <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-46">figure 46</a>). It
              takes advantage of the Amiga's sound capabilities and provides
              users with an environment to compose music using notation. The
              Exceptions did not port the actual program onto the ST; rather,
              they created a copy of the file selection screen and a part of
              the notational screen in the background.
            </p>
            <p>
              They ported seven pieces of music from Amiga games, like
              <em>Rally Master,</em> <em>Amegas,</em> and
              <em>Crashin' Robb,</em> for a total of fifteen minutes of
              high-quality, four-voice musical tunes, even though the Atari ST
              is only capable of playing three-voice music. Users can switch
              music by choosing a tune with the cursor keys.
            </p>
            <p>
              This digisound was impressive enough, given the ST's sound and
              music limitations, but the most impressive screen is accessed by
              pressing the "O" key (O for overscan). This opens up the
              overscan screen with no lower border and, for the first time on
              the Atari ST, no right border. Removing the right border and
              using the space for graphics was considered impossible. The
              Exceptions had done it.
            </p>
            <p>
              They filled the screen with a pulsating pattern reminiscent of
              Yayoi Kusama's colorful polka dot art (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-47">figures 47</a> and
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-48">48</a>). Along the lower
              half of the screen, a transparent text scrolled. The blue
              fractal patterns shine through the red text.

              The Exceptions not only broke two new limits of the Atari ST by
              opening the right border and playing Amiga-quality digimusic,
              but they also managed to break a personal record for the longest
              continuous time spent programming without interruption.

              While the demo-makers were visiting their friend and
              <em>ST-NEWS</em> editor Richard Karsmakers, they wrote the whole
              demo in one continuous hackathon. Karsmakers chronicled the
              creation of the Amiga Demo in <em>ST-NEWS.</em><sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-56" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-56">[56]</a></sup>
              They worked on the demo for 22 hours straight, fighting against
              the hardware, using tricks to overcome limitations, and all the
              while eating pizza and drinking soft drinks until most everyone
              fell asleep. Udo Fischer (-ME-) was left to wrap up the
              programming. Karsmakers contributed the contents of the
              scrolling text, Jochen Hippel (Mad Max) managed to faithfully
              convert the Amiga music to the ST's hardware, and Erik Simon
              (ES) created the graphics and the transparent font they needed
              for the demo.

            <p>
              In 1988, Tarik Ahmia, the editor-in-chief of the established
              mainstream computer magazine
              <em>ST-Magazin 68000er</em> published by
              <em>Markt & Technik</em> in Bavaria, reached out to Udo Fischer,
              Erik Simon, Michael Raasch, and Gunter Bitz. The Exceptions had
              become minor celebrities in the Atari ST demoscene, but they
              were not widely known to the average computer-using audience.
              Tarik Ahmia convinced them to write a series of articles about
              their programming tricks. In five articles in 1988, The
              Exceptions revealed all of their programming secrets to a major
              audience and became widely known outside of the niche of the
              demoscene.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-57" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-57">[57]</a></sup>
              In photos, they were depicted as silhouettes and marketed as
              secret insiders with only their first names used. This made them
              seem forbidden and taboo, like true hackers. Undoubtedly, it
              contributed to their allure.
            </p>
            <p>
              Their series of articles was called <em>Die Hexer</em> (German
              for "The Wizards" or "The Witchers").
            </p>

              Figure 50: The Exceptions wrote about their programming tricks

            </p>

            <p>
              Under Tarik Ahmia's leadership, the
              <em>ST-Magazin 68000er</em> not only covered computing news,
              reviewed games and applications, and provided type-in
              programs,<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-58" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-58">[58]</a></sup>
              but it offered several series examining how to produce creative
              work on the Atari ST. Aside from The Exceptions, the magazine
              featured series by commercial artists who produced their own
              magazines using desktop publishing software on the ST, and
              others creating 3D animations for commercial TV stations in
              Germany.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this thesis, the articles in <em>ST Magazin 68000er</em> are
              used as sources for the technical explanations of the
              achievements of the demos. An in-depth analysis would exceed the
              scope here, but they warrant a short examination.

            <p>
              By the late 1980s, computers had become widespread tools in
              corporate administration. They were used for calculations,
              transactions, word processing and other business-related tasks.
              The use of computers as creative tools had been pioneered in the
              1960s and 70s, but only started to break into commercial design
              in the late 1980s. By the time The Exceptions were featured in
              <em>ST Magazin 68000er,</em> the print industry around news
              media and publishing was in the process of transforming to
              digital production. The first Hollywood movies had started to
              feature computer animations. The tools used in the professional
              sector like Linotype page setting systems for page layouts in
              publishing and the Quantel Paintbox for infographics on TV were
              expensive and specialized. Home computer enthusiasts could
              identify that even though these systems were far more advanced
              than their own 16-bit computers, at their core, the expensive
              machines were not that much different than the higher-end home
              computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              By showcasing early hobbyist digital creatives like The
              Exceptions, computer magazines demonstrated the creative
              potential of the machines. They provided instructions on how
              home users could produce their own works and inspire them to
              produce images, music, animations and even demos. Users could
              recognize that the expensive professional computers were much
              more capable, but they could also see that compared to the
              expensive machines, the gap between the capabilities of their
              own computers was closing. A Paintbox sold for $100,000 only
              half a decade earlier could display photorealistic images with
              256 colors from a potential color palette of 16 million. Yet the
              artists used a graphics program on it that resembled the paint
              applications on the Atari ST, the Apple Macintosh and the
              Commodore Amiga. On a $1000 Atari ST, with a lot of effort, home
              users could create their own graphics that came close to the
              professional graphics; they could see the potential lying
              dormant in the technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              By not only reporting <em>about</em> The Exceptions, but by
              having them write a series of articles, The Exceptions explained
              how to produce impressive results with the ST. Computer
              enthusiasts now saw the human beings behind the technology, and
              that The Exceptions were using the same tools available to home
              users. Even though it can be assumed that the editors of the
              magazine revised the articles provided by The Exceptions, there
              is still an endearing awkwardness in the text. Each article
              features a different member explaining their skill; for example,
              explaining how to program smooth scrolling routines, how to
              produce more colors on the screen, how to paint graphics, and
              how to write music. The articles are full of enthusiasm and
              pride at the achievements, yet they are apologetic in their
              descriptions of the solutions because they emphasize that there
              might be better ways to achieve the same results. The articles
              were clearly written by young people who had figured out
              techniques and wrote about them in a language that resonated
              with young readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              By the mid-1980s, only a very few programmers were being
              promoted by name. They were not yet treated like authors of
              books or rock stars. This was the time before John Carmack and
              John Romero, who later became famous for the 3D-shooter
              <em>Doom,</em> and before Shiguro Miyamoto at Nintendo became
              famous. In the United States, there were already a small number
              of famous games developers like Richard Garriott (aka "Lord
              British") who had created the <em>Ultima</em>-Series of
              computer-role-playing-games; Roberta Williams who had written
              <em>King's Quest</em> and many other games at her company
              <em>Sierra On-Line;</em> and Sid Meier who created
              <em>Pirates</em> and had his name put on the box. In the UK, the
              <em>Bitmap Brothers</em> were being promoted by their publisher
              <em>Mirrorsoft</em> like rock stars, using the full public
              relations power of Robert Maxwell's media empire.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-origin-04-59" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-footnote-04-59">[59]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              But they all seemed so far away, none of them were from a small
              town in Germany. It was a breakthrough for members of the
              demoscene to be featured in a print magazine.

            <h3 class="mt-5">4.4 Conclusion: The Time of Breakthroughs</h3>
            <p>
              This was the year that The Exceptions peaked as demo-makers and
              produced the most demos. Their demos broke numerous hardware
              limitations, like the ST's color limits, the bottom and the
              right screen borders, and the limits of the ST's sound chip with
              their music conversions from other systems like the C64 and the
              Amiga. In the B.I.G-Demo, they produced the longest scrolling
              text to date.
            </p>
            <p>
              It was also the year that The Exceptions started to collaborate
              with others in the demoscene. At first with Alyssa whose
              programming trick for the removal of the bottom border was used
              in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show. Then, in the B.I.G.-Demo, they
              collaborated with the diskmag <em>ST-NEWS</em> for advertising
              and distribution, as well as the diskmag's editor Richard
              Karsmakers for project management and scrolling text.
            </p>
            <p>
              1988 was the year that The Exceptions found recognition outside
              of their small scene by reaching a larger audience in the print
              publication <em>ST-Magazin 68000er,</em> explaining their
              programming tricks. But this was also the year that the main
              members of The Exceptions decided to become legitimate game
              programmers. They would no longer have time to create full
              demos, but the move was necessary for them to make a living from
              their skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              And by 1988, The Exceptions had already inspired so many others
              in the Atari ST demoscene that they had passed the torch onto
              other demo-makers. However, in the next year, The Exceptions
              would still collaborate with others on their mega-demo: the
              biggest demo of all.
