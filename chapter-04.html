                This thesis has mapped the journey of The Exceptions in the
                years 1987 to 1989 to discuss how technical limitations
                motivated the creation of demo art. The Exceptions became better
                programmers, graphics artists and musicians to overcome
                technical limitations. This section discusses the conclusion
                that limitations in art do not hinder its creation but rather
                stimulate ingenuity and inventiveness.

                4.1 Breaking Limitations as the First Motivating Factor
              </h3>
              <p>
                Computer Demos are a means of artistic expression. They are
                real-time computer animations with music. The youth subculture
                called the "demoscene" emerged from the illegal cracker scene in
                the 1980s. They showcase their abilities in exceeding the
                technical capabilities of home computers. Members of the
                demoscene were geographically distributed in these days before
                the web and were also fragmented by computer systems: developing
                for different computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each Computers in the 1980s and 1990s had its own limitations.
                They were limited in memory, graphics, and sound capabilities.
                The creators of demos sought to prove that the system they chose
                to create for was more capable than the manufacturer's
                specifications. They often compared their achievements with
                other demo creators, particularly those on more capable
                machines. They distributed their demos freely. In many cases,
                they shared their programming techniques freely in the
                demoscene.
              </p>
              <p>
                The group to create the first demos on the Atari ST computer
                system was The Exceptions. The Exceptions were initially a
                cracking group on the Commodore 64, cracking and pirating games.
                They started creating demos on the Atari ST, to prove that their
                machine of choice could meet the capabilities of the competing
                Commodore Amiga. Through their demo art, The Exceptions inspired
                others to create their own demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                1987 was the first year The Exceptions, still a cracking group,
                started creating intro screens for their cracked games. They
                released their first demo, README.PRG, that broke the Atari ST's
                color limitation, producing artwork in more than 16 colors. They
                created smooth horizontal scrolling by with a horizontal
                scrolling text, something the Atari ST was thought not to be
                capable of. They established their rivalry with the Commodore
                Amiga, the technically superior machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                They taught themselves the necessary skills to produce their
                demo art. Erik Simon (ES) pixel painted. Udo Fischer (-ME-)
                programmed in Motorola 68000 assembly code. Jochen Hippel (Mad
                Max) wrote music for the limited sound chip of the Atari ST.
                They approached the creation of their demo art from the
                craftsman's position, the technician's perspective, thus
                creating "digital folk art".
              </p>
              <p>
                In their next two demos, they produced music that was comparable
                to the superior SID chip in the Commodore 64 using ST's limited
                sound hardware: The Little Sound Demo and the Little Color Demo.
                With their demos, they reached out to a community of crackers
                and demo-makers, inspiring their peers to produce their own
                works. The same year, The Exceptions collaborated with fellow
                demo-coder Alyssa to remove the lower border of the ST's screen
                for the Super-Neo Demo Show. They were influenced by fantasy and
                science fiction films and heavily borrowed the aesthetic from
                computer games for their demos' graphics and effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                In their scrolling texts they used self-aggrandizing language,
                taking jabs at their peers, but were self-deprecating about
                their own work.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1988, The Exceptions peaked as demo-makers and produced the
                most demos to break the numerous hardware limitations, like the
                ST's color limits, the bottom and the right screen borders, and
                the limits of the ST's sound chip. In their B.I.G-Demo, they
                produced the longest scrolling text to date on any system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this year The Exceptions found recognition outside of the
                demoscene when they published a series of programming articles
                in <em>ST-Magazin 68000er</em>. This was also the year that The
                Exceptions decided to use their acquired skills to become game
                developers and no longer create demos. The Exceptions inspired
                others in the Atari ST demoscene, they had passed the torch on
                to other demo-makers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before leaving the demoscene in 1989, The Exceptions
                collaborated with other demo-groups to create the Union Demo
                that broke the last hardware limitations of the Atari ST.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using their inquisitiveness and ingenuity, they "tickled out"
                the last pieces of performance from the Atari ST, broke its last
                limits, and helped create a thriving demoscene on that system.
                They led the way and demonstrated what could be done, thus
                uniting demo-groups from different countries and backgrounds to
                produce collaborative demo art projects in a pre-web age.

              <h3 class="mt-5">4.2 Reading the Absence</h3>
              <p>
                What is striking about these demos is not only what they depict
                but also what they do not depict. Topics often examined in art
                (e.g., explicit political statements and messages, depictions of
                sexual content or nudity) are completely absent in these demos.
                This is due to the very nature of the demos, their main message
                was one of technical exhibitionism. The demo-makers explicitly
                deliver astounding technical achievements and brag about them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether specifically intended or not, they definitely have a
                socio-economic, even political, message by freely distributing
                their demo art and sharing their programming knowledge, thus
                representing early manifestations of the open source movement.
                The music and some of the graphics do not respect the laws of
                copyright, even openly bragging at having replicated the
                commercially produced music on other computer systems. The
                images, particularly in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show, were inspired
                by commercial and copyrighted materials, lovingly replicated by
                hand in pixels. They copied the movie poster of "The Last
                Unicorn", a painting of the dragon Smaug from Tolkien's "The
                Hobbit" and paintings by the Hildebrandt brothers, commercial
                painters in their own right (see 3.1.4 Super-Neo-Demo-Show).
                Hence, the demos take inspiration from consumer culture and
                propagate the free distribution of ideas without commercial
                interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                They are not alone in this, rather without deliberately
                intending it, The Exceptions follow in the tradition of Barbara
                Kruger. Like other pop-artists Kruger appropriated consumerist
                imagery for her postmodern conceptual art to explore and analyze
                identity, sexuality and the portrayal of women in the mass
                media, and how they are distorted and objectified.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions came from the cracker scene, they did use
                copyrighted images from popular culture as a means of criticism,
                but rather out of a disregard for the copyright laws, and out of
                a personal affection for the chosen subject matter despite the
                fact that their use was illegitimate. In the late 1980s, this
                remained unnoticed by the copyright holders due to the
                restricted distribution of the demos. In a nowadays context,
                their use of copyrighted materials would likely qualify as "fair
                use".
              </p>
              <p>
                Though the term "open-source" had not yet found wide adoption at
                the time, their technical solutions were open-source in the
                truest sense of the word: The Exceptions invented their own
                routines and algorithms for their demos and shared the source
                code with the public (see 3.2.3 Mainstream Exposure). The work
                is not influenced or tamed by any sponsors or patrons that might
                have financed it; thus, the work is pure expression of
                creativity. While it can be argued that the skills and knowledge
                attained would open up many possibilities for the creators in
                the lucrative field of computer programming, graphics, and music
                composition, the demos themselves are of a completely irreverent
                nature and are not pandering to any potential employers. They
                wanted to impress their peers in their subculture.

                4.3 Subculture as the Second Motivating Factor
              </h3>
              <p>
                Breaking the technical limitations was not the only motivating
                factor to produce demo art. Working within a subculture was the
                second major motivating factor. Without recognition by peers,
                the efforts were nearly wasted. Already with their first demo,
                The Exceptions were in a state of communication with their peers
                and their audience. By giving recognition to others, they laid
                the groundwork for the creation of the demoscene subculture
              </p>
              <p>
                In the mid to late 1980s, computer usage was definitely
                spreading but it should not be forgotten that most people did
                not yet regularly use computers, let alone own them. The notion
                that art could be produced on computers was only accepted on the
                fringes. Using a computer to create art was even regarded as an
                act of cheating because computers would "do the work for you",
                something that did not happen in traditional art techniques—a
                notion born out of a lack of understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                By their very nature, the demos did not reach a large audience.
                Even within the group who owned computers, the demos only
                managed to reach the small group who owned an Atari ST. At
                first, they addressed a small group of demo-making peers. The
                process of each demo release created a new audience, reaching
                out with each subsequent release.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being part of subculture was vital to the creation of these
                demos because it was a niche that they formed for themselves. A
                niche yet without any fixed rules. The Exceptions were making it
                up as they went along.

                In the seminal work "Computers and Creativity" (edited by Jon
                McCormack and Mark d'Inverno), Alex McLean and Graint Wiggins
                write in their article "Computer Programming in the Creative
                Arts" that "Computer programming is central to the digital arts
                and is a comparatively new creative activity."

                4.4 Putting the Conclusion to the Test: Examining Limitations in
                an Art Historical Context
              </h3>
              <p>
                The conclusion of this thesis is that limitations motivate the
                creation of art. Is this applicable to other areas of art, and
                are other forms of limitation the cause for innovation and
                motivation?

                This section analyzes the life and works of artists from
                different eras of the 20th century to briefly examine how
                overcoming limitations has influenced their art. Henri Matisse,
                Lee Krasner and Yayoi Kusama each struggled against different
                constraints, evolving and innovating their art in the process.

                4.4.1 Henri Matisse and the Burdensome Weight of Illness
              </h4>
              <p>
                Henri Emile Benoit Matisse, one of the greatest painters of the
                early 20th century suffered from severe health issue for most of
                his life, yet still revolutionized art. He was celebrated as a
                master draughtsman and a painter of decorative and colorful
                works ranging from conventionally attractive paintings in a more
                naturalistic style to daring with simplified forms.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1941 at the age of 71, he underwent an emergency operation
                for intestinal cancer and survived. For most people this would
                have been a sign that the time was right for retirement. Not so
                for Matisse, despite being mortally ill and partially confined
                to a wheelchair he refused to let his physical limitations
                prevent him from producing new art. He changed his style to his
                restrictions and went on to produce some of the most vibrant and
                life-affirming images of his career: The paper cutouts,
                decoupage.
              </p>
              <p>
                He developed this technique of cutting abstract shapes out of
                color paper and mounted them to large boards. The results were
                joyful and beautifully colorful.
              </p>

              </p>

              <p>
                This new style of his work was not immediately universally
                accepted by the art world with some critics calling his work
                "paper jokes". Matisse's contemporary and "friendly rival" Pablo
                Picasso understood Matisse better than anyone else and saw the
                ingenuity in Matisse's work in his final phase. No longer able
                to stand in front of a canvas and paint, Matisse found a new
                boldness of form, simplicity and fierce colors reminiscent of
                the Pop Art movement that emerged well over a decade later. At
                the same time there is a hint of darkness in his work. He
                started creating his cutouts during the most challenging period
                of his life battling his illness and the Second World War
                raging.
              </p>
              <p>
                A pivotal piece of this period is the image of the mythical
                character Icarus plunging from the sky: The stark black
                silhouette of a human figure against a saturated blue
                background. In the context of the Second World War, the yellow
                stars surrounding the figure could be read as explosions of fire
                bursts. Even the abstract body of Icarus could be interpreted as
                a corpse.

                And yet the predominant effect of his art is joy and relief
                depicting circus figures like jugglers and clowns. Of course,
                Matisse could not do this alone. He had assistants helping him
                create his art.

                Jacqueline Duhême started working as one of Matisse's assistants
                in 1948. In an interview in the TV documentary "Henri Matisse. A
                Cut Above the Rest" in 2013 she described the method:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "He would prepare the colors and I would brush them onto paper
                with yellow, orange, red, green, according to his choice. Then
                he would cut these up and then afterwards I would put them up on
                the wall using needles and a small hammer."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Matisse did not stop painting immediately after the operation.
                He produced his final paintings in 1948. He chose to exclusively
                focus on the paper cutouts and explore the potential of this new
                medium. The cutouts started out as paintings "constructed" out
                of cutout shapes instead of brush strokes, but then took on an
                independent direction. The scale, the measurements of his
                artwork increased.

                Writer and artist Françoise Gilot who wrote about Matisse in her
                book "Matisse and Picasso: A Friendship in Art" in 1990,
                describes Matisse's process as:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Matisse was in his bed and he cut the paper with large
                scissors, he would do whatever shape he wanted. He did that very
                fast, with dynamism. In a very spontaneous manner. It was
                creation itself! He has reached a moment in his life when he was
                at one in his mind and in his body."

                In 1948 Matisse created the crowning project of his twilight
                years, he built and decorated every detail of the Chapel of the
                Rosary. He designed its stained-glass windows, the interiors,
                its three murals, right down to the colorful vestments worn by
                the priest. All created with his new technique of cutouts.
                Matisse created a haven of peace, he regarded it as his
                "masterpiece".
              </p>
              <p>
                Even then he was not yet done. He created his series of cutout
                art studying the female body "the Blue Nudes" and at the age of
                eighty "The Snail", the year before he died.

                Hence to survive in his years since his operation, Matisse
                completely reinvented his own art style and changed the medium
                of his art in his quest to overcome the limitations of his
                immobility. When interviewed for the documentary "Matisse. A Cut
                Above the Rest", Hilary Spurling, writer and Matisse biographer,
                described this drive as:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Matisse couldn't live if he couldn't work, literally. And I
                think those last years when he made the cutouts and when he was
                an invalid and bed-ridden was a complete illustration of that.
                He had to invent an art form which he could still practice and
                practice with the intensity and the passion and pour into it the
                energy and power that he had then as he always had had."

                When addressing limitations then it would be straight-forward to
                pick out Lee Krasner as a female artist who was confronted for
                her whole career with the stifling limitations of sexism and
                gender discrimination. She was after all famous for quoting a
                critic as having said:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "The first approval comes in this form: This is so good, you

                Instead, this section will focus on how transformed her work and
                style as a result of a different kind of adversity and to
                overcome the limitations of… light. As a formally trained
                colorist, she regarded it as an utmost necessity to paint in
                colors only when exposed to natural light. This she could not do
                when she set out to create her masterpiece "The Eye is the First
                Circle". Therefore, she changed her style of painting. The
                reason for this will be explained in detail after an
                introduction to Krasner.

              </p>

              <p>
                Lee Krasner was born in 1908 in Brooklyn. She was the first
                child to be born in the US in her family who emigrated from
                Russia. At fourteen she decided to be an artist and really
                stayed true to that vision despite it being an incredibly
                difficult climate for anybody but particularly a woman to become
                an artist during the great depression.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1941 she met Jackson Pollock for the first time when they
                were exhibiting together at the McMillan Gallery. She was
                familiar with Willem de Kooning and Stuart Davis, but Pollock
                was the only artist at the show that she did not know, so she
                decided to visit his studio. Their relationship became important
                to both, eventually they married. They shared their house in
                Springs, Long Island, until Pollocks death in 1956. Yet this
                relationship with the celebrated abstract expressionist Pollock
                was only one chapter in a much longer story of Krasner's life as
                an artist.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the many tender and touching things that Krasner and
                Pollock shared was that if they were working on something that
                felt threatening to them, they would pose the question to one
                another if it was a painting. If it was, then Pollock would
                assure Krasner by urging her to keep going and not give up or
                walk away.
              </p>
              <p>
                The first of the Umber series of paintings, a painting that
                would later be known as "The Eye is the First Circle", was on
                Krasner's easel in an unfinished state when she left for France.
                When in Paris she received the call from the family friend
                Clement Greenberg telling her that Pollock had died in a car
                accident.
              </p>
              <p>
                She could not walk away from her painting, she had to complete
                it even in her deadening state of grief. In an interview with
                her poet friend Richard Howard, Lee Krasner described her state
                of mind at the time:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Let me say that when I painted a good part of these things, I
                was going down deep into something which wasn't easy or
                pleasant. In fact, I painted a great many of them because I
                couldn't sleep nights. I got tired of fighting insomnia and
                tried to paint instead. And I realized that if I was going to
                work at night, I would have to knock color out altogether,
                because I wouldn't deal with color except in daylight."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Krasner moved into Pollock studio space at his farm. She was the
                executor of his estate tasked with managing his legacy. The
                studio must have been an emotionally loaded space for her. But
                she wanted to paint, and it was the largest space available to
                her. It had bright natural light flowing in through the windows.
                The available space allowed her to work on large format
                paintings by taking unstretched canvas four to five meters in
                length, attaching it to the wall. The Umber series really occurs
                at the peak of this moment of her discovering the possibilities
                of scale, the possibilities of this new space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her work on the Umber series was something she could make her
                own, follow her own artistic voice. Krasner was suffering from
                extreme insomnia, so she worked at night under artificial light.
                She could not bring herself to use colors because she regarded
                it almost a criminal act to work with color without natural
                light. Working in the brown, cream and white color palette
                retroactively named umber allowed her to continue to work even
                in these difficult circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like the later paintings in the Umber series, "The Eye is the
                First Circle" is made predominantly in raw and burnt colors in
                oil. Krasner cherished the organic properties of working in oil
                and the color or rather lack thereof had an organic quality. She
                worked physically hard on her paintings. She was only around
                1.63 tall and she would go "into" this large-scale painting
                three times larger than her, continually work on it until she
                felt that it reached a point of completion.

                When how she managed to paint in the depths of that degree of
                grief, Krasner replied:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Painting is not separate from life. It is like asking - do I
                want to live? My answer is yes - and I paint."

                4.4.3 Yayoi Kusama and the Sea of Infinite Sadness
              </h4>
              <p>
                Another important artist of the 20th century who had to overcome
                massive constraints in her life was Yayoi Kusama. She was born
                in 1929 in Japan. Her interest in art was evident by the age of
                ten years. In the 1960s, Kusama moved from the Japanese Kyoto to
                New York City and became an active participant in the world of
                art.
              </p>
              <p>
                The dominant features of her paintings were dots. Polka dots,
                colored dots on white, white dots as negative space on a colored
                background, like the stars in the heavenly canopy. Kusama said
                "With one polka dot, nothing can be achieved" because "Polka
                dots can't stay alone".
              </p>
              <p>
                Kusama experienced a troubled childhood and that resulted in
                mental health issues. Since the age of ten, she suffered from
                hallucinations. They were the reason for her use of dots,
                flashes of light, and (oddly enough) pumpkins in her art.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stigma of mental problems and the desire to understand her
                hallucinations even at a young age caused her to sink deep into
                her art. Her artistic expression in painting and her use of dots
                and colors were largely for therapeutic purposes. She believed
                that all things in the world are disintegrated and that
                everything is comprised of an infinite number of dots. She
                perceived herself as a dot in the larger universe and that each
                person in the earth is part of the hundreds of millions of the
                polka dots forming up the whole system . She used paper and
                paint to express her visions transforming them into the highly
                unique renditions characterized by eternal repetition as
                observed in the displays in modern displays exhibiting her work.

              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Making art was something she seems to have done in opposition
                to her family, but she also was innately talented. If you look
                at the early drawings, they are innately exquisite" says Frances
                Morris, curator of Kusama's 2012 exhibition at Tate Modern. "The
                challenges to become an accomplished artist in a Japanese
                provincial milieu must have driven her. At some point she would
                have to escape."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                For the better part of her early career of arts, Kusama
                struggled to achieve fame and gain recognition in the art world.
                One of the major hindering factors was her battle with mental
                health problems. She refused let these challenges impede her and
                pursued her interests despite these significant health issues.
                Kusama was faced with strategic limitations from society as she
                hailed from the conservative society in Japan. Racism, sexism,
                and social censure were equally major cultural limitations that
                Kusama had to overcome to become one of the most successful
                female artists of the 20th century.
              </p>
              <p>
                Richard Castellane, former owner of the Castellane gallery,
                described the effect of Kusama's installations:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "She was taking away your ability to focus, breaking all
                boundaries in space... and the exhibitions that I had, in
                particular the 'Peep show', that did the job. It was an
                octagonal room, it was painted black, and there were openings
                where you could stick your head in. And the ceiling of it set up
                a series of lights ... Up till Kusama there were many artists
                from the renaissance on who were involved with perspective and
                infinity. But it was all a fake, because you knew, you, the
                viewer, were always aware that you were the master... that it
                was a painting that was encompassed by a frame and the artist
                was playing with space, but it wasn't enveloping you." (Tate

                Particularly when she started to break into the art market in
                the United States,
              </p>
              <p>
                Kusama faced resistance based on her race as a Japanese in the
                post-war period and more universally just for being a woman. In
                1977 she was exhausted and returned to Japan after suffering
                severe mental health problems. She was admitted in a psychiatric
                hospital in Tokyo. Anxiety and depression were her constant
                companions, permanent effects of her mental health issues. These
                personal, emotional and perceptional limitations did not deter
                her from practicing painting as an art. On the contrary, she
                succeeded in using art as a form of therapy and a way of
                expressing her perception of the world around her. Kusama
                described her approach as:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Every time I have had a problem, I have confronted it with the

              </p>

              <p>Tate Modern's Frances Morris described Kusama as:</p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "To go back to Tokyo and to start from scratch again, for
                Kusama, was quite extraordinary... because she wasn't known
                there, and she hadn't been recognized. Clearly, the strains and
                stresses of life, the memories, had forced her to withdraw, but
                what she's always done, she has always managed that process
                incredibly well. Kusama is now living in a mental institution,
                but by day she occupies across the street in a busy suburban
                neighborhood of Tokyo a very well-appointed studio facility,
                where she has a team of assistants and she has a space for her
                painting, a space for her library, her archive. And every
                morning she gets there, and she is the consummate professional
                and she works from nine to six. I think there is a sort of a
                'managing madness' about Kusama, which is so utterly sane. It is
                quite interesting, she has used her trauma, she has used these
                experiences in her past, she has been able to harness the
                experiences that might drive other people insane to enormously
                productive ends. She's an extraordinary person in that way."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Kusama's life and art was rightly contrasted with artists such
                as van Gogh who inflicted self-harm and attempted suicide due to
                their mental health issues. Kusama found a new and effective way
                of expressing her world through art. An endeavor largely
                celebrated in the modern world of social media. Collections of
                her work attract a significant number of visitors in museums and
                exhibitions and her art has found a deep resonance with a modern
                audience.
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "I fight pain, anxiety, and fear every day, and the only method
                I have found that relieves my illness is to keep creating art. I
                followed the thread of art and somehow discovered a path that
                would allow me to live."

              <h3>4.5 Discussing Limitations</h3>
              <p>
                The section above is not intended to be presumptuous. It serves
                to demonstrate that limitations and the human potential to
                overcome them is an inherent driving factor of art (and a lot of
                other areas). Juxtaposing the technical limitations that drove
                The Exceptions to produce their demo art with the limitations
                surpassed by highly regarded figures from art history as
                Matisse, Krasner and Kusama examines how overcoming limitations
                acts as a motor in the work of other artists, artists whose work
                has greatly impacted history.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are artists who struggled with physical health problems,
                grief and mental issues forcing them to transform their art in
                ways that would not have been necessary otherwise, but in the
                process, they elevate their art, advance unique modes of
                artistic expression to become icons in art history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet limitations—both perceived or actual—and the urge to
                transgress them is a fundamental motivation for artists and
                among them, by demo-makers.

                4.6 Computing Since the Days of The Exceptions
              </h3>
              <p>
                What has happened in computing since The Exceptions? In short:
                pretty much everything we know today. Since 1989, we have seen
                the success of Microsoft Windows, the unstoppable expansion of
                the world wide web, mobile computing and smartphones, machine
                learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain and
                crypto-currencies, and a games industry with a larger total
                revenue than the complete movie business.
              </p>
              <p>
                Software development has changed too. The Exceptions and other
                demo-makers as well as game creators used to write software for
                specific machines in assembly language. Most software today is
                written for platforms, i.e. the web, specific desktop operating
                systems like Windows or MacOS, smartphone platforms like Android
                or iOS, or gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch, the
                Microsoft XBox or the Sony PlayStation. To summarize it all in a
                few paragraphs would be an exercise in futility. Yet there are
                some key developments that need to be pointed out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some platforms transcend the hardware, they run on any
                sufficiently powerful system. The first of these is the web
                itself. Web browsers have turned into their own computing
                platform that opens a pressure valve into the information super
                stream and lets worlds of data flow into it. Software has
                abstracted away from the actual hardware it runs on. The
                operating system of a device provides multiple layers, e.g.
                low-level functions and drivers, application programming
                interfaces and libraries, and finally the user interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                On top of that third-parties run their frameworks and engines,
                i.e. large collections of proven tools that enable more and more
                complex software projects and take away the need to develop
                common features every time from scratch. These are web
                frameworks, but also gaming engines like Unity and the Unreal
                Engine. Game engines are whole systems for creating everything a
                game needs like the game logic and the rules, the 3D worlds and
                the characters, the animation and all of the interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                On the one hand, over the past thirty years, game development
                has moved from 2D to 3D and has at the same time become less
                dependent on the actual hardware and more dependent. Games
                developers very rarely go right "to the metal", they don't
                program at the very basic hardware level, they use frameworks or
                ideally a game engine like Unity or the Unreal Engine that runs
                on the major computing and gaming platforms and is independent
                of the actual hardware. On the other hand, games and 3D creation
                demand a high computing performance, they are dependent on fast
                CPUs and powerful graphics cards, so that they can produce
                newer, more elaborate and flashy games to draw in the gamers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The wide variety of different home computers in the 1980s has
                disappeared. Personal computers have settled on the commercial
                duopoly of the majority OS Microsoft Windows and the single
                manufacturer operating system of Apple's MacOS with a perpetual
                market share that hovers at ten percent. A multitude of Linux
                distributions compete for the desktops and notebooks of end
                users. Most commercial applications have an open-source
                equivalent, created and maintained by large groups of
                enthusiasts who pore in their time and ingenuity. They have
                found an unlikely alliance with large corporations and public
                entities like governments, universities and municipalities that
                sponsor and help develop open-source software to their own
                benefit, and at the same time to the benefit of all. For
                example, every dollar a large company like Novell spends on
                LibreOffice , puts more features into the hands of users free of
                charge. Every developer that a large pharmaceutical company like
                Pfizer puts on a Drupal project , helps elevate the content
                management system for all other users. Every contribution by a
                large CPU manufacturer like AMD to the Blender 3D software puts
                capable tools into the hands of future 3D graphics artists. Even
                though the global annual adoption of Linux seldom exceeds single
                digits percentages, in the background, the majority of the
                internet runs on Linux servers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The demoscene as this tiny corner of the open-source world, this
                niche of new media art, this small fraction of programming
                enthusiasts thrives to this day. Members of the demoscene still
                create their art, participate in demo-parties and competitions.
                The computing performance available to users today is so vast,
                that the demoscenes choose artificial limitations. They might be
                memory limitations, e.g. a full demo in 64Kbytes, or time
                limitations, e.g. develop a demo in a 48 hour hackathon, or use
                old computing hardware that is far less capable than the
                hardware today but, at the same time, in the hands of the right
                developers, far more capable than anyone would have thought.
              </p>
              <p>
                And decades ago, on one of these obsolete computers, the Atari
                ST, The Exceptions were "ground zero" for their part of the
                demoscene.

              <p>
                In the oral history of the Atari ST demoscene as chronicled by
                Marco Breddin in Breakin' the Borders, one of The Exceptions,
                Erik Simon, said:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "In the beginning we met in my room [to work on our demos] and I
                would fall asleep at around 3 in the morning while the other
                guys would happily continue coding. It was a great time. We did
                things that nobody had done before, which grants a very special
                quality of creative satisfaction. In hindsight, the refusal to
                accept limits without question was essential to our later
                professional - and hobbyist careers. Apart from that, the Atari
                ST scene was very friendly and stuck together. There was less
                rivalry than in other demo scenes. The logical way in which
                people from all over Europe became friends at demo parties and
                worked together on projects has strongly influenced my viewpoint
                on the important questions of life and politics."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                This shows how every single piece of computer art, from the
                humblest demo, like README.PRG, to the grandest mega-demo, like
                the B.I.G. Demo and the Union Demo, is a unique piece of art.
                They may not appeal to all sensibilities or represent the
                pinnacle of the demoscene, but they are art all the same. They
                exist because they can, not because they must. They exist
                because the demo-makers chose to make them so.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions exercised their imagination, creativity, and
                ingenuity to turn their ideas into a reality. That is something
                to be treasured. Art makes its creators what they are. When we
                as humans learned to use tools, we have been driven to express
                ideas that transcend the limitations of what is possible, the
                limitations of our craft, the limitations of our existence. We
                have been compelled to create things that will outlast our
                fleeting interest, perhaps even our short lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Demo-makers wanted to create images and music that enthrall and
                captivate their audience. Their art is an expression not only of
                who they are, who they were, but of who they might be—the good
                and the bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                The early demoscene allowed the demo-makers to explore their
                highest aspirations and their deepest fear of failure. Through
                the power of compassion and kindness, they united to become a
                creative force that was more than the sum of its parts. A force
                to shatter the technical limits of the hardware they chose to
                create demos with motives from fantasy and science fiction as
                well as abstract algorithmic images on the Atari ST computer
                system. Yet, we can see some of their cruelty and hatred
                manifesting in their work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stories of how they created their demos thrill us with their
                courage and determination, adventure and excitement and a bit of
                anger. We learn how they worked on their demo art and how they
                overcome the restrictions. This imparts us with wisdom and
                knowledge, stirs our wonder and imagination. The demo makers
                working together inventing the code and the process when
                creating their demos shows us the strength of friendship and
                collaboration and still emphasizing individual achievements.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions were not driven by commercial interests or by
                requirements of a sponsor. They were free to be bold and
                creative, inspiring and challenging. And they could be
                provocative, swanky show-offs.
              </p>
              <p>
                Perhaps we recognize aspects of ourselves in their undertakings,
                at least to a certain extent, as we try to convince the machines
                that we work with every day to do what we need them to do, what
                we want them to do. Perhaps we look up to these beautiful nerds
                , the demo-makers, because we want to take back some of the
                control from digital machines—control that demo-makers so aptly
                demonstrated belongs squarely in the hands of users.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the heroic character Tron in the eponymous movie from 1982
                said so fittingly: "I fight for the users!" Today, we are all
                users. Can we find solace in the thought that someone might be
                fighting for us to shatter the limits?
