                The year 1989 was the culmination of the Atari ST demoscene thus
                far. What started out as a single-screen demo with a scrolling
                text now evolved into barnstorming displays of animation,
                multilayered scrolling, color explosions, and 3D graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                No single demo-maker or team could deliver this breadth of
                effects, graphics, and music. It was the
                <strong>Union</strong> of multiple demo-groups, like The
                CareBears, Deltaforce, the TNT-Crew and, of course, The
                Exceptions, that came together to produce two of the best demos
                on the Atari ST in the year. The borders broke. The quest for
                true overscan was finally successful. The whole monitor area now
                became the playground for demos.

                January 1989 saw the culmination of the Atari ST demo efforts so
                far. The multiple demo-groups had joined forces to produce the
                Union Demo. The Exceptions teamed up with the TNT Crew, the Care
                Bears, Level 16, the Replicants (a French cracker team), and the
                Delta Force.
              </p>
              <p>
                The <strong>Union Demo</strong> was the first true mega-demo
                that deserved its name. In it, all the limits of the Atari ST
                were broken. In nearly a megabyte of compressed features, each
                demo-group had their own section; users moved a player character
                through a scrolling building to select the different screens,
                acting as an interactive menu.
              </p>
              <p>Marco Breddin described the Union Demo as:</p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Here it is, the computer without custom chips, without sprites,
                without scrolling, without a synthesizer that was built using
                rather too few quality checks but filled with passion, the charm
                and energy of a young computer generation that will give their
                all to break the borders and don't care about system
                specifications."<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-origin-04-60" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-footnote-04-60">[60]</a></sup>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Six demo-groups worked on the mega-demo:
                <em>The CareBears (TCB),</em> <em>TNT-Crew,</em>
                <em>Delta Force,</em> the <em>Replicants,</em>
                <em>Level 16,</em> and <em>The Exceptions,</em> with eighteen
                contributors to create the thirteen screens of the Union Demo.
                The examination of each dazzling screen starts below.

                The startup screen appears when the demo loads, featuring the
                Union logo and sliding distorted text that moves across a
                vertically scrolling backdrop. The text layout is distorted
                along a wobbly sine curve, with the screen using more than the
                ST's standard 16 colors with music playing in the background.

                This demo screen was created by The CareBears, Programming by
                Niclas Thissel (Nick/Nic) and Jas from The CareBears (TBC), with
                graphics by Erik Simon (ES), sound and music conversion by

                This screen serves as the menu for the whole demo. It is a
                computer game where users control the character of Charly, an
                aardvark figure that moves across a paved surface that scrolls
                horizontally. The wall behind it has several doors: a door for
                each segment of the demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                The main area of the screen scrolls smoothly in all directions.
                Users move the character to a door, and then they can enter a
                different section of the demo. Beneath the interactive menu
                area, a smooth horizontal scrolling text moves across the full
                width of the screen using the left and right border. So together
                with the main area and the scrolling text, there are two
                independent scrolling areas. An alien landscape shines through
                the text, scrolling at a different speed than the letters. Of
                course, the screen features more than the standard 16 colors the
                ST can usually display at once.
              </p>
              <p>
                The screen was programmed by Gunter Bitz (6719) of The
                Exceptions, with graphics by Erik Simon (ES). The graphics for
                the character of Charly were drawn by Micky. The scrolling text
                was programmed and written by The CareBears, the left and right
                borders were removed by the TNT-Crew, and Jochen Hippel (Mad
                Max) converted the music, which was composed by Jeroen Tel.

              <p>
                This screen features a vertical background scrolling smoothly
                with a large horizontal text scrolling across the lower part.
                Effectively, this demo screen showed two large scrolling areas.
              </p>
              <p>
                The scroller at the bottom of the screen features parallax
                scrolling, where both the text and the hi-tech background move
                across the screen, but at different speeds. The graphic shows a
                field of explosions like the pattern of napalm bombing seen from
                afar, and the CareBears have placed the painted words: TCB and
                "Beat 'dis!" across the pattern of explosions and had it scroll
                vertically.
              </p>
              <p>
                All the while, approximately 450KB of digitized, high-quality
                music can be heard. The voice samples "Get down to the funky
                beat" are repeated to a techno beat. Users need an Atari ST with
                at least one megabyte to hear the music. The demo-makers knew
                that in 1989, this was not yet a widespread configuration, so
                machines with less RAM would play chip music by Mad Max instead
                of the sampled sounds.
              </p>
              <p>
                This part of the demo was programmed by Niclas Thissel
                (Nick/Nic) and Jas with graphics by Erik Simon (ES). The font
                was created by Nic using the PC-Font-Maker. The sampled sound
                and music were provided by An Cool. Mad Max programmed the sound
                chip to play the music composed by Fred Gray.

              </p>

              <p>
                The spherical demo screen by Delta Force is split up into three
                main sections. The top segment shows the logo of Delta Force,
                which rhythmically flips to change to the logo of the Union and
                back again.
              </p>
              <p>
                The section in the center shows a three-dimensional textured
                plane with three bubbles floating above it that pulsate to the
                music corresponding to the Atari ST's three sound channels. The
                bubbles cast shadows on the plane.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bottom part of the screen shows another scrolling text. This
                time, it is distorted along a sine curve as it horizontally
                flows across the screen, and each character's colors fluctuate
                in wave patterns. The text moves back and forth and occasionally
                flips vertically. It was clearly not only created to be read by
                the audience, but also to impress with its transformations. The
                background music was converted from the Commodore 64 game,
                <em>Mega Apocalypse.</em>
              </p>

                This screen was programmed by New Mode. The graphics were
                provided by Slime and Questlord from Delta Force. The graphics
                for the purple bubbles were created by Erik Simon (ES). The
                music was composed by Rob Hubbard and converted to be playable
                by the ST by Jochen Hippel (Mad Max).

                This screen has some of the first 3D graphics in a demo. In
                front of a starfield in space, fast and solid models are
                spinning across the screen. First, the logo of the TNT-Crew,
                that created this section of the demo, then a simplified version
                of the Union logo. The TNT-Crew had a 3D version of the famous
                Amiga ball, but their version had its center carved out. The
                final two models were a spaceship ripped from the game
                <em>Starglider II</em> and a carrier from
                <em>Carrier Command.</em> The presentation was accompanied by
                chip music, and users could switch between models by pressing

                The Atari ST had no hardware to support smooth scrolling, but
                the TNT-Crew wanted to prove that it was possible to program a
                smooth horizontal scroller (that had been done before) in
                addition to programming four layers scrolling horizontally at
                independent speeds, simply to outdo their peers.
              </p>
              <p>
                This screen features a slowly moving bubble pattern in the
                background. On top of that, a techno-organic layer scrolls
                across the screen. A green layer in unapologetically shrill
                colors speeds over the two background layers. To top it off, the
                scrolling text dashes over multiple planes. The four-layer
                scrolling is smooth at 50 frames per second. To add a final
                touch, the screen features more than 100 colors and is
                accompanied by digitized music.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a user presses the arrow keys, the scrolling direction of
                the bubbly background layer changes. The smoothness and fluidity
                of the scrolling make this one of the more impressive screens of
                the whole demo.

                Starballs is probably the least impressive screen in the Union
                Demo. It shows a blue space with bubbles shooting towards the
                audience that scale fluently for a fake perspective effect. The
                Union logo hovers transparently on top of the screen while a
                relatively small scrolling text moves across the bottom of the
                screen. Unfortunately, the Starballs screen does not break any
                new ground. The background music was inspired by David Lynch's
                movie, <em>Dune.</em>

                The Wobbly Sprites screen created by the demo-group the
                Replicants shows two scrollers with an alpha effect. In the
                layer under the words "The Union" at the top and the bottom of
                the screen, just peeking in between the contours, two scrolling
                texts rush by that can only be read if you really focus on them.
                Thirteen sprites forming the name of the demo-group dance along
                sine waves and wobble across the screen. Six raster color bars
                move up and down at different speeds.

                This was the very first time that the Atari ST could be coerced
                into using the full display and remain stable while doing so.
                The demo-makers group Level 16 perfected programming the
                electron beam to achieve this; the Atari ST's whole screen was
                now a stage for demos.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-origin-04-62" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-footnote-04-62">[62]</a></sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                The top of the screen shows an abstract landscape framed by what
                looks like brains. In the center, the sun is setting to a raster
                horizon with dozens of colors. The handles of the demo-makers
                are scattered across the golden plane.
              </p>
              <p>
                The centerpiece is the Level 16 logo. A pipe runs through it
                from the right side of the screen, where the ST usually shows a
                border, across and behind the logo to the left side. In an
                allusion to a simple Rube Goldberg machine, the pipe spews blue
                liquid into a funnel, exactly where the left border should be
                visible. The base of the logo sports a simplified cityscape with
                letters spelling out "Worldwide" beneath it.
              </p>
              <p>
                A pool of blue liquid with two splashes and the ever-present
                bubbles occupies the lower part of the screen. The whole screen
                is constantly traversed by a sprite in the shape of the Union's
                letter "U," moving into and out of areas that were previously
                reserved for the ST's screen borders, proving that this limit
                had now been broken.
              </p>
              <p>
                How did the demo-makers conquer the whole screen? The screen
                height is about 412 lines, and the Atari's hardware counts each
                scanline so that it knows which line the monitor's beam is
                drawing at each moment. When the line has drawn the left border,
                the Atari ST starts to top draw the actual graphics; it stops
                drawing graphics at the right border. When the beam reaches
                bottom line of the screen, the ST stops drawing graphics.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Atari ST could work using the North American NTSC standard
                and the European PAL standard. On a US monitor, the ST would
                switch its display to 60 Hz to display 60 pictures per second
                with a slightly smaller main area; on a European monitor, the ST
                would display 50 pictures per second with a larger main area.
              </p>
              <p>
                The demo-makers at Level 16 realized that if they switched the
                computer from the European display frequency to the North
                American display frequency at just the right point, they could
                fool the hardware into continuing to draw into the border. This
                required very precise coordination of each instruction and
                knowing the exact position of the monitor's beam at any time so
                that the demo could switch frequency at the right point. To use
                the left border, the ST was forced to switch to the 71Hz
                frequency of the monochrome resolution for a split second to
                confuse the display hardware. This pulsating distortion of the
                machine's synapses allowed the ST to use the full screen. It
                became a carefully coordinated clockwork of colors and
                coordinates.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Atari ST was complex enough to be powerful, but still simple
                enough that a person could understand every aspect of its
                hardware to hack it. And Level 16 hacked it to do exactly what
                they wanted.
              </p>
              <p>
                The screen was programmed by Ilja from Level 16 with graphics by
                Don from Level 16 and Erik Simon (ES) from The Exceptions. The
                music featured on this screen is an original composition by Mad
                Max.

                While Level 16's fullscreen part of the Union Demo may
                technically be the most impressive section, the third scroller
                by The CareBears is not only technically impressive, but also
                aesthetically spectacular.
              </p>
              <p>
                The CareBears created a multilayered scrolling screen. The top
                and bottom parts of the screen have about a dozen layers
                smoothly scrolling by at different speeds to create a parallax
                effect and a feeling of perspective depth. Like the warming
                inevitability of a summer's breeze, the multiple planes speed
                across the screen as smoothly and as fluently as a lover's
                pounding heart.

                In the center of the screen, The CareBears logo becomes
                algorithmically distorted and mathematically flipped while
                pounding digi-techno plays. The fonts are metallic and inspired
                by the "heavy metal" aesthetic. They were, at the same time,
                cheap and glossy, inspired by computer games.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over and across the whole screen, a sine wave of text whips
                across, moving in and out of the top and bottom sections. And
                all of this with hundreds of colors on the screen at the same
                time (see <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-66">figure 66</a>).

              <p>
                The total size of all the data of all the screens of the Union
                Demo was 1400KB, and the Exceptions helped find a way to
                compress all of this to 900KB. Udo Fischer (-ME-) programmed
                compression routines that unpacked the required parts of the
                demo when a user accessed one of the screens. The Union Demo
                came on a double-sided, 3.5" floppy disk that only fit 720KB.
                But The Exceptions came up with an extended disk format to fit
                the full 900KB of crunched code, graphics, and music (for more
                details on disk formats and how to archive them, please see
                Appendix I).
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, this meant that the disk could not be copied the
                regular way using the Atari ST's operating system. Therefore,
                The Exceptions devised a copying program as part of the demo

                Demo as they liked. It formatted the target disk to take
                advantage of the extended disk format. Naturally, The Exceptions
                added their own color effects to this screen while the copying

                The Union Demo has a hidden screen that can be accessed by
                moving the Charly character on the menu screen to one of the
                plants. Users are presented with the ST Soundtracker Sample-Mon,
                a music player that can reproduce the high-quality four-voice
                music from the Amiga on the ST's three-voice sound chip. When
                moving the mouse, the mouse pointer is replaced by computer
                game-like sprites.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Soundtracker was programmed by Gunther Bitz (6719). With
                graphics by Hexagon and mouse sprite graphics by Erik Simon
                (ES), it features an original composition by Mad Max.

              <p>
                The Atari ST started out as the underdog of the 16-bit computer
                generation. It was affordable, but the hardware was rushed to
                market. The rushed hardware led to limitations on the number of
                colors on screen, big screen borders, no dedicated graphics
                chips for scrolling, no hardware support for sprites, and a
                sound chip that was used in 8-bit computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Union Demo broke all these limitations. All the demo screens
                showcased dozens of colors that far surpassed the ST's standard
                16 color limitation. The fullscreen section by Level 16 removed
                all the borders and used them to display graphics. The CareBears
                (TCB) and the TNT-Crew created super-smooth multidirectional
                scrollers, and in some cases, multiple scrollers on the same
                screen moving horizontally and vertically. The Replicants had
                more than a dozen sprites whizzing around fluidly. And the
                limitations of the ST's AY/YM sound chip was blown away by Mad
                Max, who managed to tickle music worthy of a Commodore Amiga out
                of the archaic sound hardware.
              </p>
              <p>
                As The CareBears (TCB) adequately put it in their Wow!
                Superscroller: "The Union needs no custom chips." Where the
                hardware left them wanting, the demo-makers made up for it in
                their ingenuity for programming the software.
              </p>
              <p>
                Stefan Posthuma, a demo-maker known as Digital Insanity from the
                demo-group The Lost Boys, wrote about the Union Demo in his
                "History of Demo Programming on the ST" in the diskmag
                <em>ST-NEWS:</em><sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-origin-04-63" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-footnote-04-63">[63]</a></sup>

                "This was it. Everybody thought this to be the ultimate demo,
                something never to be equalled. Well, in a sense this is true.
                'The Union Demo' is a true classic, making a heavy impact on the
                demo world. 'The Union Demo' contained a few screens by The
                CareBears, including the 3D-sinus-and-a-whollottamore-stuff (or
                something) scroller which is considered by most people to be the
                best demo screen ever written. With their screens The CareBears
                established themselves once and forever and their coder Nic
                (Niclas Thissel) was to become a living legend afterwards."

                The Exceptions might have pioneered the Atari ST demoscene, but
                to create the Union Demo, six disparate groups from all over
                Europe came together to create thirteen demo screens: Niclas
                Thissel (Nic), Jas, Micky, and An Cool from The CareBears (TCB),
                New Mode, Slime and Questlord from Delta Force, Hexadez, Jojo,
                and Hexogen (Michael Bittner) from the TNT-Crew, Excalibur and
                Rank Xerox from The Replicants, Ilja and Don from Level 16, Erik
                Simon (ES), Jochen Hippel (Mad Max), Gunter Bitz (6719), and Udo
                Fischer (-ME-) from The Exceptions (TEX).

              <p>
                The knowledge, abilities, and powers of these eighteen
                individuals contributed to the technical masterpiece that
                surpassed all restrictions of the ST; now, the Atari's demoscene
                was alight with ideas and innovation.

                The Union Demo was not only the swan song of The Exceptions as
                demo-makers; 1989 was the last year that The Exceptions spent
                any substantial amount of time on creating demo art. They moved
                on to game development and founded Thalion, together with other
                key players in the ST demo scene, including members of the
                TNT-Crew, The CareBears (TCB), and DeltaForce. They would spend
                the rest of 1989 working on their game releases. Meanwhile,
                other demo-groups from all over Europe saw what could be done
                with the Atari ST. The game was on.

                In 1989, The CareBears from Sweden released their impressive
                Swedish New Year Demo, and not to be outdone by their
                competition in the scene, they followed that with the Cuddly
                Demo and the Whattaheck Demo in the same year.

                Thalion Software, the new home of The Exceptions in Gütersloh,
                Northrhine-Westphalia in West Germany, started to release games
                for the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga. Among their first
                releases included the beat-em'-up game
                <em>Chambers of Shaolin,</em> the space shooter
                <em>Warp,</em> the jump-and-run
                <em>Seven Gates of Jamabala,</em> the shoot-'em-up
                <em>Leavin' Teramis,</em> and the puzzle game
                <em>Atomix.</em> They were technically sophisticated games with
                intricate graphics, smooth scrolling, and superior sound and
                music. Most were met with rave reviews and sold well in the
                market.

                The crowning achievement of Thalion was the game that The
                Exceptions had started working on right after the B.I.G. Demo, a
                fantasy role-playing game called <em>Dragonflight.</em> They
                worked on the game until they achieved the level of perfection
                they wanted, and it was released in 1990.
                <em>Dragonflight</em> was based on an original story by Erik
                Simon, who also produced the graphics, while Udo Fischer
                programmed the game, and Jochen Hippel composed the music. The
                <em>ST-NEWS</em> veteran Richard Karsmakers wrote the novella
                that came as part of the package. The game was well-received and
                spawned two sequels.

                scrolling shoot-'em-up game. In both <em>Wings of Death</em> and
                in <em>Dragonflight,</em> there is a red dragon like the one we

              <p>
                The Exceptions were not the best overall on the Atari ST, but
                they were the first, and therefore laid the groundwork for the
                best to come. Together with their fellow demo-makers, they
                learned their trade on a marginal computer with limited
                hardware. With their inquisitiveness and ingenuity, they managed
                to expose the last bits of performance out of the Atari ST and
                create demos that broke the last technical limits. While doing
                so, they created demo art and contributed to spawning a thriving
                scene on that system.
              </p>
              <p>
                By leading the way, provoking their competitors, and showing
                what can be done, The Exceptions united groups from all over the
                world to produce collaborative demo art projects in a pre-web
                age. Then, they used their skills, discipline, and dedication to
                become game developers. The Exceptions changed the demoscene
                taking it from a basement hobby to a much larger phenomenon and
                lived to pursue their aspirations in the process.

                5.5 Computing Since the Days of The Exceptions
              </h3>
              <p>
                What has happened in computing since The Exceptions? In short,
                essentially everything we know today. Since 1989, there has been
                the success of Microsoft Windows, the unstoppable expansion of
                the world wide web, mobile computing and smartphones, machine
                learning and artificial intelligence, blockchain and
                crypto-currencies, and a games industry with a larger total
                revenue than the movie business.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-origin-04-64" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-footnote-04-64">[64]</a></sup>
              </p>
              <p>
                Software development has changed too. The Exceptions, other
                demo-makers, and game creators used to write software for
                specific machines in assembly language. Most software today is
                written for platforms, such as the web, specific desktop
                operating systems like Windows or MacOS, smartphone platforms
                like Android or iOS, or gaming consoles like the Nintendo
                Switch, the Microsoft Xbox, or the Sony PlayStation. To
                summarize it all in a few paragraphs would be an exercise in
                futility; yet there are some key developments that need to be
                pointed out.
              </p>
              <p>
                Some platforms transcend the hardware and can run on any
                sufficiently powerful system. The first of these is the web
                itself. Web browsers have turned into their own computing
                platform that opens a pressure valve into the information super
                stream and allows copious amounts of data to flow into it. The
                operating system of a device provides multiple layers, such as
                low-level functions and drivers, application programming
                interfaces and libraries, and finally, the user interface.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally, third party software run their frameworks and
                engines, i.e., large collections of proven tools that enable
                more and more complex software projects and take away the need
                to develop common features every time from scratch. These
                include web frameworks, but also gaming engines like Unity and
                the Unreal Engine. Game engines are whole systems for creating
                everything a game needs, such as the game logic and the rules,
                the 3D worlds and the characters, the animation, and all the
                interactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                Over the past thirty years, game development has moved from 2D
                to 3D, and at the same time, has become less dependent on the
                actual hardware and more dependent on the frameworks and
                engines. Games developers very rarely go right "to the metal";
                they do not program at the very basic hardware level, but
                instead use frameworks or ideally a game engine like Unity or
                the Unreal Engine that run on the major computing and gaming
                platforms and is therefore independent of the actual hardware.
                On the other hand, games and 3D creation demand a high computing
                performance and are dependent on fast CPUs and powerful graphics
                cards, so that they can produce newer, more elaborate, and
                flashy games to draw in the gamers.

                The wide variety of different home computers in the 1980s has
                disappeared today. Personal computers have settled on the
                commercial duopoly of the OS Microsoft Windows and the single
                manufacturer operating system of Apple's MacOS, with a
                consistent market share that hovers at ten percent. A multitude
                of Linux distributions compete for the desktops and notebooks of
                end users. Even though the global annual adoption of Linux
                seldom exceeds single digits percentages, in the background,
                most of the internet runs on Linux servers. Most commercial
                applications have an open-source equivalent, created, and
                maintained by large groups of enthusiasts who pore in their time
                and ingenuity. They have found an unlikely alliance with large
                corporations and public entities like governments, universities
                and municipalities that sponsor and help develop open-source
                software for their own benefit, and the benefit of all. For
                example, every dollar a large company like Novell spends on
                LibreOffice<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-origin-04-65" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-footnote-04-65">[65]</a></sup>

                developer that a large pharmaceutical company like Pfizer puts

                helps elevate the content management system for all other users.
                Every contribution by a large CPU manufacturer like AMD to the
                Blender 3D software<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-origin-04-67" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-5-footnote-04-67">[67]</a></sup>

                The demoscene thrives to this day as a tiny corner of the
                open-source world and a niche of new media art. Members of the
                demoscene still create their art and participate in demo-parties
                and competitions. The computing performance available to users
                today is so vast that the demoscenes implement artificial
                limitations. They might be memory limitations, e.g., a full demo
                in 64Kbytes, or time limitations, e.g., to develop a demo in a
                48-hour hackathon, or use old computing hardware that is far
                less capable than the hardware today to prove that in the hands
                of the right developers, it is far more capable than anyone
                would have thought.
