              I <em>always</em> thought that demos were cool. On my old
              Commodore Amiga 600 in the early 1990s, I used to watch these
              real-time animations excitedly, mesmerized by their abstract
              graphics, pumping soundtrack and inventive images. Not only
              content to stare amazed at, I started copying the art style in
              art software, trying to recreate and capture what appealed to me
              about their imagery. I like to think that without this
              fascination I would never have pursued a career in IT.
              Eventually, my interests moved away from demos and, to my shame
              I must confess, I forgot about them. If I ever thought of demos
              again, I considered them to be phenomena of the 80s and 90s.

            <h3 class="mt-5">Rediscovering Demos</h3>
            <p>
              Around a decade ago, I attended an event at the Subotron digital
              games culture community in the MuseumQuartier in Vienna. The
              presentation and exhibition provided a showcase of the works of
              European demo-makers. I was surprised to learn that the creator
              scene around demos was not only alive and well but positively
              thriving. As technology had permeated all parts of our lives, so
              had creative expression come to inhabit the digital domain, with
              demos as the incumbent digital forebearers of the media art that
              grew out of home computers.
            </p>
            <p>
              While demo-makers in the early years created demo art to surpass
              the limitations of their computers, they were now faced with the
              comparatively limitless power and performance of modern
              machines. And they started to deliberately introduce their own
              limitations. In some cases, these were time limits to create a
              demo or size limits for the memory used. For me it was inspiring
              and breathtaking to see what these wizards had created. I was
              impressed by their technical expertise but had a premonition
              that there might be something that I just didn't understand at
              the time. Then it struck me: The limitations kicked their
              creativity into high gear.
            </p>
            <p>
              With this thesis, I try to reveal the underlying truth to this
              premonition. It is one thing to be dazzled by colorful
              presentation and a completely different thing to investigate and
              examine early demos from the perspective of a media art
              historian. On my journey into the microcosm of those demo-makers
              I chose to explore, I learned how art emerges at the
              intersection of technology and culture and how strong a
              motivation the aspiration is to overcome limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              And last but not least, because I still think that demos are
              cool.

            <p>
              I would like to thank my supervisor Dr.Mag.art Gerald Nestler
              for providing the best supervision a student could ask for.
              Strict enough to challenge my shortcomings but kind enough to
              guide me back onto the right track.
            </p>
            <p>
              My special thanks go to Univ.-Prof. Dr. Oliver Grau and Wendy
              Coones, M.Ed, at the Danube-University Krems for creating their
              uniquely fascinating, supremely invigorating and wonderfully
              multi-faceted MediaArtHistories program and for always being
              there for their students, sometimes at impossible hours.
            </p>
            <p>
              And finally, I would like to thank my fellow student Carl
              Philipp Hoffmann for graciously listening to me driveling on
              about demos on old computers. Without our lively conversations,
              many of the thoughts I brought to paper would never have become
              coherent.
