                I <em>always</em> thought that demos were cool. On my old
                Commodore Amiga 600 in the early 1990s, I used to watch these
                real-time animations excitedly, mesmerized by their abstract
                graphics, pumping soundtrack and inventive images. Not only
                content to stare amazed at, I started copying the art style in
                art software, trying to recreate and capture what appealed to me
                about their imagery. I like to think that without this
                fascination I would never have pursued a career in IT.
                Eventually, my interests moved away from demos and, to my shame
                I must confess, I forgot about them. If I ever thought of demos
                again, I considered them to be phenomena of the 80s and 90s.

              <p>
                Around a decade ago, I attended an event at the Subotron digital
                games culture community in the MuseumQuartier in Vienna. The
                presentation and exhibition provided a showcase of the works of
                European demo-makers. I was surprised to learn that the creator
                scene around demos was not only alive and well but positively
                thriving. As technology had permeated all parts of our lives, so
                had creative expression come to inhabit the digital domain, with
                demos as the incumbent digital forebearers of the media art that
                grew out of home computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                While demo-makers in the early years created demo art to surpass
                the limitations of their computers, they were now faced with the
                comparatively limitless power and performance of modern
                machines. And they started to deliberately introduce their own
                limitations. In some cases, these were time limits to create a
                demo or size limits for the memory used. For me it was inspiring
                and breathtaking to see what these wizards had created. I was
                impressed by their technical expertise but had a premonition
                that there might be something that I just didn't understand at
                the time. Then it struck me: The limitations kicked their
                creativity into high gear.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this thesis, I try to reveal the underlying truth to this
                premonition. It is one thing to be dazzled by colorful
                presentation and a completely different thing to investigate and
                examine early demos from the perspective of a media art
                historian. On my journey into the microcosm of those demo-makers
                I chose to explore, I learned how art emerges at the
                intersection of technology and culture and how strong a
                motivation the aspiration is to overcome limitations.
              </p>
              <p>
                And last but not least, because I still think that demos are
                cool.

              <p>
                I would like to thank my supervisor Dr.Mag.art Gerald Nestler
                for providing the best supervision a student could ask for.
                Strict enough to challenge my shortcomings but kind enough to
                guide me back onto the right track.
              </p>
              <p>
                My special thanks go to Univ.-Prof. Dr. Oliver Grau and Wendy
                Coones, M.Ed, at the Danube-University Krems for creating their
                uniquely fascinating, supremely invigorating and wonderfully
                multi-faceted MediaArtHistories program and for always being
                there for their students, sometimes at impossible hours.
              </p>
              <p>
                And finally, I would like to thank my fellow student Carl
                Philipp Hoffmann for graciously listening to me driveling on
                about demos on old computers. Without our lively conversations,
                many of the thoughts I brought to paper would never have become
                coherent.
