                For many people, algorithms are complex math that quietly works
                in the background, powering the technology all around us. But
                algorithms can be so much more than that.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artists use algorithms to create media art. One kind of
                algorithmic art is called computer demos, computer generated
                real-time video clips that show what kind of graphic and sound
                effects can really be done by using computer hardware to its
                full potential. In many cases, demos are inspired by the
                aesthetics of video games.
              </p>
              <p>
                This computer art subculture - known as the <em>demoscene</em

                - is a place where programs become sensory audio-visual
                experiences in a display of the artistic, musical, and
                development skills of their creators. In many cases, demos
                appropriate the aesthetics of video games.

                You don't need to be an expert to appreciate the creativity, the
                beauty, and the ingenuity behind software-based art - especially
                when considering the ever-present technical limitations creators
                must work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                After all, technology is constantly evolving; a demo created
                only a decade ago can become obsolete and lost - a victim of its
                own creative solutions. Demos are often made using the
                undocumented capabilities and features of old computers by
                developers seeking to push the machines to their limits and
                beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the early 1980s enthusiasts develop demos on a wide range
                of computer systems like the Commodore 64, Sinclar ZX Spectrum,
                the Commodore Amiga, Windows PCs and the Atari ST. Particularly,
                on classic retro-hardware the demo creators use techniques
                employed in the development of games, in some cases even
                pioneering these techniques themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most notable groups of demo creators were
                <em>The Exceptions</em>. In the late 1980s they were the first
                to create demos on the Atari ST home computer. They did not
                accept the limitations of the hardware capabilities of this
                16-bit machine and they set out to break them. They wanted to
                use more colors on the screen than the ST was capable of
                displaying, they wanted to produce better music than the ST's
                limited sound chip was capable of producing, they wanted to
                match the effects seen on more capable and more expensive
                systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 1987 to 1989, The Exceptions produced half a dozen demos
                that proved that the Atari ST was far more capable than even the
                manufacturer had expected. By distributing their demo programs
                on public domain disks and Bulletin Board Systems (BBS), they
                reached out to computer users and other enthusiasts to amaze and
                inspire them. This is how they created the demoscene on the
                Atari ST.

              <h3>Topic, Objective and Methodology of This Master Thesis</h3>
              <p>
                This master's thesis describes the demo art created by The
                Exceptions. The demo-group that originated as Crackers, who
                illegally pirated and distributed games and other software, and
                moved away from the illegal scene to create demos. The focus of
                this thesis is to analyze their productions from 1987 to 1989,
                which were so successful that they inspired other groups
                internationally to create demos and subsequently form a
                collective of demo-groups, aptly named The Union.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the core of this master's thesis lies the question:
                <strong
                  >How did technical limitations and cultural boundaries enable
                  and motivate the process of creating computer demos instead of
                  hampering and limiting it?</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                The thesis investigates the cultural context that The Exceptions
                worked in, their motivating factors, and the technical areas
                they pioneered and how limitations enable and motivate the
                creation of art. It retraces the steps that led from the first
                demos, created by The Exceptions out of the technical
                limitations of the Atari ST. Then, it covers how they broke most
                of the technical restrictions by teaming up with other
                demo-makers all over Europe. Thus, they laid some of the
                groundwork for the networked and connected community that
                thrives today as the demoscene. The hypothesis that limitations
                are a motivating factor in art is put to the test by applying it
                not only to the demo scene, but to a wider variety of
                individuals in art history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the thesis examines the conservation and preservation
                of media art in the archival context. The different methods to
                salvage demo files, run demos on original hardware and in
                emulation are described. In the final appendix, the thesis
                concludes with a discussion of archives of media art and the
                technical possibilities in implementing them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The central part of the thesis, the examination of the demos,
                uses the methodology of the text analysis. The appendices employ
                the more practical methodology of the case study of implementing
                archives using different options and testing their advantages
                and disadvantages.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why are computer demos important objects to study in art
                history? Many so-called "bedroom coders" in the 1980s emerged
                from the demoscene, i.e. young programmers who started writing
                software at the start of the home computer revolution from their
                bedrooms before they had actual office<sup
                  ><a
                    id="limits-introduction-origin-00-02"

                    >[2]</a
                  ></sup
                >. This led to many individual careers in the areas of software
                development, but also in other areas of science, technology,
                engineering and math (STEM).
              </p>
              <p>
                Music created in the early demoscene became the foundation for
                an aesthetic called chip music or chip tunes. Musicians choose
                the style of video game music. This form and practice have long
                been a vivid area of experimentation in the fringes of new media
                art, but in the past few years has found its way into the
                mainstream as a retro-aesthetic e.g. in Hollywood movies such as
                <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em> (2010) and
                <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> (2017). Furthermore, in the 1990s, many
                musicians and DJs emerged from the demoscene or were inspired by
                it<sup
                  ><a
                    id="limits-introduction-origin-00-03"

                    >[3]</a
                  ></sup
                >. This is particularly true for the vivid techno music scene of
                mid 1990s Germany but also as recently as Kanye West, who wrote
                his first music on a "tracker" on the Commodore Amiga.<sup

                In essence, computer demos are the definition of new media art
                on the edge of technology. They expose and break the engineering
                constraints of emergent media.

              </h3>
              <p>
                In demo history, the era before the mid-1990s is referred to as
                "old school" (or "oldskool" as it is also referred to in the
                demoscene and in the literature<sup

                  ></sup
                >). The chosen scope of this thesis falls in the middle of this
                "old school" time period. Why are these particular years
                important in the Atari ST demoscene?
              </p>
              <p>
                The year 1987 saw the release of the first demo for the Atari
                ST, created by The Exceptions. There had been demos on other
                systems before, but overall, the demoscene was in its infancy.
                In this first year, The Exceptions released two more demos and
                continued their productive streak into 1988. This was the year
                an editor from the German magazine <em>68000er ST-Magazin</em>
                befriended The Exceptions and persuaded them to reveal their
                coding tricks in a series of articles. Not only did this turn
                them from an insider group to minor celebrities in the hobbyist
                computer scene of the Atari ST, but it had two important
                effects:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  Even though The Exceptions did not use their real names in the
                  articles and only went by their cracker handles, they were now
                  exposed to a much wider audience. This accelerated their
                  separation from the <em>cracker</em> scene, and they turned
                  "legit," solely as creators of demos. This, in turn, advanced
                  their plans to become game developers.<sup
                    ><a
                      id="limits-introduction-origin-00-06"

                </li>
                <li>
                  The exposure of <em>demos</em> as a concept and the demos
                  created by The Exceptions, including all the tricks,
                  processes, and methods they used to program them, had an
                  inspirational effect on other coders and would-be coders. The
                  inner workings and intricacies of a demo were laid bare, and
                  all the audience had to do was to work hard enough to
                  understand and replicate them, then they too could create
                  demos. If the German-speaking demoscene was not already born,
                  then this was its metaphoric birth. Numerous individual
                  demo-makers and demo-groups started creating demos for the
                  Atari ST.<sup

                  The Exceptions and the Atari ST demoscene that took its
                  inspiration from them organized the first demo parties for the
                  system with the
                  <em>ST News International Christmas Coding Convention</em>
                  (STNICC) in 1990. There had been many copy parties where
                  cracked games were shared but STNICC was the first party
                  completely devoted to demo-making.<sup

              </ol>

              <p>
                By 1989, The Exceptions started to team up with other
                demo-groups like <em>DeltaForce</em> and
                <em>The CareBears (TCB)</em> to form the <em>Union</em>. This
                year saw the release of the first major megademo for the Atari
                ST, a form of demo particular to this system; the Union broke
                most of the ST's technical limits in their <em>Union Demo.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                In these three short years, the Atari ST demoscene evolved from
                the efforts of a tightly knit group to a union of multiple
                demo-groups, culminating in what can be clearly identified as a
                pre-web network of demo-makers by 1989—even though they did not
                know it at the time.

              <h3>Limitations by Choice</h3>
              <p>
                Today, programmers, musicians, and graphic artists in the
                demoscene deliberately set limits on the size or scope of the
                little stand-alone demonstration programs they write. Creators
                of these audio-visual presentations choose to adopt limitations,
                e.g., limits in the size of the program or the number of lines
                of code that it can occupy at most, and then they produce the
                most ingenious, dazzling, and impressive art they can within
                these restrictions. They do not regard restrictions as a
                disadvantage but as a challenge to show their complete command
                of a computer's graphics and sound within strict boundaries.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nowadays, demo-makers meet at demo parties—large get-togethers
                of like-minded developers in locations that can host hundreds.
                At demo-parties, like the annual <em>Revision</em>,
                <em>Evoke</em>, <em>Nordlicht</em>, and <em>Nova</em>, the
                organizers set challenges with deliberate limitations<sup

                >. Competing participants need to adhere to these restrictions
                and produce interesting and innovative graphics, sound, music,
                and effects within the chosen constraints. A jury of peers then
                picks the winner, and awards are handed out in different
                categories. The winners often do not receive valuable prizes;
                rather, the reward of gaining the admiration of their peers is
                what drives them. They prove themselves to be smarter, more
                inventive, and "better" than their competitors. Graphics artists
                might, for example, be limited in the number of colors they can
                use in their images or the resolution and size of the whole
                image or of specific objects, sometimes with only 32 color
                shades or a canvas smaller than most icons on a modern-day
                smartphone. Musicians might be limited to a specific number of
                concurrent music channels, with as few as three electronic
                instrument voices being a possible restriction. Developers are
                limited by the memory available to them to be inventive. Typical
                size constraints are, for instance, a maximum of 4KB of storage
                (yes, these are <em>kilobytes</em>). At other demo parties and
                in different categories of a competition, the storage
                restriction might be a bit more generous at 64KB.

                Try a little experiment for yourself: launch Microsoft Word,
                open a new document, and save it as it is, devoid of any words.
                Then, open your file browser, seek out the file you just saved,
                and look at the document properties to determine the file size.
                That empty file will already occupy around a dozen kilobytes
                without any actual content in it! These are the kinds of
                constraints that demo-makers choose to work within.
              </p>
              <p>
                The idea that drives these experiments is that adding
                constraints and limits can boost creativity. Modern computers
                are very capable in their graphics and sound capabilities but at
                the same time seemingly limitless, that they require large teams
                of developers, artists, and even project managers to produce
                impressive results. The sheer number of possibilities can be
                staggering, mind-boggling, and, ultimately, paralyzing. By
                embracing "creativity through limitation," digital artists avoid
                being overwhelmed with the possibilities. The clearly defined
                limitations give them laser-sharp focus on delivering something
                wonderful.

                So far, most of the academic research has focused on the demos
                created since the turn of the millennium and the large,
                established demo-parties since then. Yet the origins of the
                demoscene lie in the early 1980s and therefore before the
                Internet, before smartphones and a computer on every desk. The
                demo programs were distributed on Bulletin Board Systems (BBS)
                or by manually copying them from disk to disk and including them

              <h3>Limitations by Necessity</h3>
              <p>
                Nowadays, the limitations imposed on demos are by choice and by
                consensus. This used to be different. In the 1980s, the
                limitations were a function of the capability of computers of
                the day. The hardware was limited in memory, storage, and
                processor speed, as well as in the graphics capabilities, music,
                and sound effects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The 8-bit home computers of the 1980s, like the Commodore 64,
                Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Atari 8-bit line (XL/XE), the Amstrad
                CPC, and the Japanese MSX machines, usually had around 48 to
                128KB of RAM and their processor speeds ranged from 1MHz to
                3.5MHz, depending on the CPU architecture (based on the MOS 6502
                or the Zilog Z80). Typical screen resolutions ranged from 160 x
                200 pixels to around 320 x 200 pixels.
              </p>
              <p>
                To put these specifications in perspective: An icon on the home
                screen of an iPhone has a resolution of 256 x 256 pixels. The
                graphics on these old machines had odd color restrictions. Most
                had a total of only 16 colors available, but you could not use
                them freely. For instance, on the ZX Spectrum, you could only
                use two colors in an 8 x 8 block of pixels. The Commodore 64 was
                a bit more flexible, being able to display four colors in 4 x
                8-pixel blocks in the low-resolution color graphics mode. While
                the Commodore 64 had an arcade-quality synthesizer sound chip,
                the original ZX Spectrum had a mono beeper. Most alarm clocks
                had better sound than the first models of the ZX Spectrum.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Amstrad CPC line and the Atari 8-bit XL/XE line were more
                flexible with their graphics. The Amstrads had low-resolution
                color graphics with vibrant colors and few restrictions on the
                use of the colors. Beyond that, they even provided higher
                resolution graphics with a few colors for word processing and
                other business applications. In this mode, they provided 80
                columns of text out of the box. This was the "holy grail" for
                business applications in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The
                8-bit Atari's had a comparatively large palette of colors,
                providing a total of 128 colors to choose from, but you could
                only use around 16 at the same time.

                Programmers, graphic artists, and sound artists had to learn to
                work within these constraints. For the first few years, the
                commercially available games and applications for these
                computers were as pedestrian as you might expect. But some
                developers had greater ambitions. They learned to fully
                understand the hardware of these comparatively simple machines.
                They experimented and discovered ways to trick the hardware into
                exceeding the previous limits. Games and applications started to
                look, sound, and feel much more advanced than they had any right
                to be.
              </p>
              <p>
                The next generation of machines, the 16-bit computers, were
                released in the mid-1980s, right after the launch of the
                "almighty" IBM PC compatibles. Starting with the Apple Macintosh
                and the Sinclair QL, then the Atari 520ST and the Commodore
                Amiga, these computers had a variation of the Motorola 68000 CPU
                running at 7-8MHz. The base models came with 128KB of RAM, but
                most were really only usable if they had 512KB of RAM. Priced at
                over US-$ 2500, both the Apple Macintosh and the IBM PC were
                squarely targeted at the high-end market, the other 16-Bit
                machines were priced and marketed as the next generation of
                <em>home computers</em>. Like the Macintosh, both the Amiga and
                the Atari ST (pronounced "Es Tea") came with a mouse. Their
                operating systems had icons, windows, and menus just like the
                operating systems we use today. Of course, they were not as
                refined, but they were much easier to fully grasp with their
                limited functionalities. The 16-bit computers even started to
                support expensive peripherals that only a few private
                individuals could afford but businesses needed, like hard disks
                and a second monitor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Apple Macintosh made great strides in education, graphics,
                desktop publishing, and some areas of business; there were fewer
                games than on other systems and little-to-no demos in the first
                years. The Atari ST and particularly the Commodore Amiga looked
                and sounded like the video game cabinets in the arcades. They
                appeared to be ideal for gaming and, by extension, for demos
                with their lush color graphics and ample memory.

                Even though this new generation of machines was more advanced,
                they were still simple enough that diligent and talented
                developers could learn <em>all</em> aspects of the hardware, all
                the tricks of the trade to eke out the last bits of performance.
              </p>
              <p>
                Attaining this level of expertise was not easy, it demanded
                expertise. Most developers never achieved the mastery necessary
                to completely exhaust the hardware's potential. Yet, even if
                they didn't, these machines had ample performance that
                nonetheless provided great results, at least in most cases.

                Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Prior Academic Research
              </h3>
              <p>
                The demoscene as a field of academic study is relatively young.
                Yet, a number of definitive works exist already. These writings
                by academics, such as Doreen Hartmann, Daniel Botz, Lassi
                Tasajrvi, and Markuu Reunanen, are astoundingly comprehensive
                and breathtakingly insightful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hartmann's doctoral thesis was published in book form as
                <em>Digital Art Natives.</em> Botz's
                <em>Kunst, Code und Machine,</em> together with Tasajrvi's
                <em>Demoscene: The Art of Real-time</em> and Reunanen's
                licentiate thesis
                <em>Computer Demos - What Makes Them Tick?</em> are masterful
                exemplars of academic research cast in eloquent writing. They
                are one of the reasons why for beginning the journey to write a
                master's thesis on this topic, albeit in a micro-analytic
                manner, swapping their breadth for the details of a specific
                scene for analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is one aspect that ties the quite different work of
                Hartmann, Botz, Tasajrvi, and Reunannen together. Out of the
                necessity to describe and analyze a new area of research, their
                work is admirably overarching, defining the ground rules for
                further research and finding and determining the historic
                principles from the perspective of the latter-day 2000s and the
                mature demoscene. By then, the demoscene had established its
                formal structure. Though it is bound to further develop and
                transform, by the 2000s, the scene had found confidence and
                pride. Both attributes positively cried out for a canonical
                history.

                The Atari ST demoscene, while immensely productive and
                inspirational, never produced the vast number of demos as the
                scene around the Commodore machines, so research in this area
                has always been limited. Seminal literature on the Atari ST has
                only recently been released. Marco A. Breddin wrote a trilogy of
                oral history books that he calls
                <em>Atari ST and the Creative People.</em> The three books are

                Breddin does not limit his works to the demoscene; he delivers
                the exemplary undertaking of describing the Atari ST
                development, gaming, music, and software scene over a ten-year
                time period ranging from the early days of the Atari ST through
                the release of the TT workstation, the expanded Atari STE, the
                phenomenal Atari Falcon 32-bit computer, and the Atari Jaguar
                video game system, until the Atari Corporation went out of
                business in the mid-1990s. The writer of this thesis has
                supported Marco Breddin's crowd-funding campaigns and is listed
                as one of the supporters in the third volume (and - of course -
                misspelling it).

                In the past few years, the study of demos has shifted towards
                more detail-oriented research. In her article
                <em>Demo Age: New Views,</em> Digital Humanities researcher

                The demoscene is one of many manifestations of hacker culture.
                In this context, it is tempting to explore seminal works on
                hackers, for example, the exciting accounts of the ingenious,
                the illuminating, and the strange, such as Bruce Sterling's
                hilarious

                  Frontier</em
                >
                and Stephen Levy's historic examination
                <em>Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution.</em> A similar
                chord is struck in

                We could go back even further to the very origins of computing
                as we know it with <em>Alan Turing: The Enigma</em> by Andrew
                Hodges and Douglas Hofstadter, published in 2014. We could
                explore the dark side of the early days of information
                processing as described in
                <em
                  >IBM and the Holocaust: The Strategic Alliance Between Nazi
                  Germany and America's Most Powerful Corporation</em
                >
                by Edwin Black, first published in 2001 and rereleased in an
                expanded edition in 2012. Black recounts the sad and enraging
                tale of how pre-computing tabulation machines were used by the
                criminal Nazi regime in World War II Germany to analyze,
                catalog, and ultimately decimate whole populations on an
                industrial level. But these historic stories, while engrossing
                and disturbing, would go far beyond the scope of a master thesis
                devoted to a specific demoscene.

                Demo-makers were part of the open-source movement and culture as
                it emerged in the early 1990s. The ground-laying works on open
                and free software by Richard Stallman would apply here and Eric
                S. Raymond's <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar.</em> The
                downright delightful <em>Hackers and Painters</em> by Paul
                Graham cannot be recommended enough. It discusses not only open
                source, but also the tension between creativity and coding and
                how to think like a programmer.

                They are digital artists creating algorithmic art using the same
                tools, the same general-purpose computers used in business,
                gaming and research. Just like their predecessors in the past,
                demo-makers today still explore the capabilities of computer
                hardware to learn how to leverage it to produce art. They are a

                Other areas, particularly coding, were, at the time, not
                regarded as acts of artistic creativity, but the consensus that
                inventive coding does, in fact, constitute artistic creativity
                has shifted towards acceptance in the decades since, as argued

                Standing on the shoulder of these giants, this thesis explores
                and describes the Atari ST demoscene and focuses on the most
                important demo-group of the system's early years, the
                Exceptions. By exploring this narrowly defined scope, this
                thesis attempts what other works of research only seldomly try,
                which is to analyze and delve deeply into specific
                manifestations and works of the early days of a small part of
                the demoscene, reveal how limitations affect and propel the
                artists, to come to a larger conclusion of general validity.

                Original Text in German: "Die Demoszene entstand aus der
                illegalen Cracker-Kultur, trennte sich aber mit der Zeit fast
                völlig von ihr und richtete ihre interne Struktur ganz am
                künstlerischen Wettbewerbsgedanken aus. Der Wettstreit um die
                beste Demo ist bis heute der stärkste Antrieb für Produktivität
                und Innovation innerhalb dieser Non-Profit-Kultur." Page 7.
