              <p>
                For many people, algorithms are complex mathematical equations
                that quietly work in the background, powering the technology
                around us. But algorithms can be much more.
              </p>
              <p>
                Artists use algorithms to create media art. One kind of
                algorithmic art is called computer demos. A demo is a
                computer-generated real-time video clip that shows what kind of
                graphic and sound effects can be achieved using the computer
                hardware to its full potential. In many cases, demos are
                inspired by the aesthetics of video games.
              </p>
              <p>
                The computer art subculture, known as the demoscene, is a place
                where programs become sensory audio-visual experiences in a
                display of the artistic, musical, and development skills of
                their creators.
              </p>
              <p>
                One does not need to be an expert to appreciate the creativity
                and ingenuity behind software-based art, especially when
                considering the ever-present technical limitations creators must
                work with.
              </p>
              <p>
                After all, technology is constantly evolving; a demo created
                only a decade ago can become obsolete and lost; a victim of its
                own creative solutions. Demos are often made using undocumented
                capabilities and features of old computers by developers seeking
                to push the machines to their limits and beyond.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since the early 1980s, enthusiasts have developed demos on a
                wide range of computer systems like the Commodore 64, Sinclair
                ZX Spectrum, the Commodore Amiga, Windows PCs and the Atari
                ST.<sup

                  ></sup
                >
                On classic retro-hardware in particular, the demo creators use
                techniques employed in the development of games, in some cases
                even pioneering these techniques themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
                One of the most notable groups of demo creators were
                <em>The Exceptions,</em> who were the first to create demos on
                the Atari ST home computer in the late 1980s. They did not
                accept the limitations of the hardware capabilities of this
                16-bit machine and instead set out to break them. They wanted to
                use more colors on the screen than the ST could display, produce
                better music than the ST's limited sound chip was capable of
                producing, and match the effects seen on more capable and more
                expensive systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                From 1987 to 1989, The Exceptions produced half a dozen demos
                that proved that the Atari ST was far more accomplished than
                even the manufacturer had expected. By distributing their demo
                programs on public domain disks and Bulletin Board Systems
                (BBS), they reached out to computer users and other enthusiasts
                to amaze and inspire them. This is how they created the Atari ST
                demoscene.

                Topic, Objective and Methodology of This Master's Thesis
              </h3>
              <p>
                This master's thesis describes the demo art created by The
                Exceptions. The demo-group first originated as crackers but
                moved away from illegally pirating and distributing games to
                create demos. The thesis focuses on the analysis of their
                productions from 1987 to 1989, which were so successful that
                they inspired other groups internationally to create demos and
                subsequently form a collective of demo-groups, aptly named The
                Union.
              </p>
              <p>
                At the core of this master's thesis lies the question:
                <strong
                  >How did technical limitations and cultural boundaries enable
                  and motivate the process of creating computer demos instead of
                  hampering and limiting it?</strong
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                This thesis investigates the cultural context that The
                Exceptions worked in, their motivating factors, the technical
                areas they pioneered, and how limitations enable and motivate
                the creation of art. It retraces the steps that led from the
                first demos, created by The Exceptions out of the technical
                limitations of the Atari ST. Subsequently, it recounts how they
                broke most of the technical restrictions by teaming up with
                other demo-makers all over Europe. Thus, they laid some of the
                groundwork for the networked and connected community that
                thrives today as the demoscene. The hypothesis that limitations
                are a motivating factor in art is put to the test by applying it
                not only to the demoscene, but to a wider variety of individuals
                in art history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, the thesis examines the conservation of media art in
                the archival context, including an examination of the different
                methods to salvage demo files and run demos on original hardware
                and in emulation. In the final appendix, the thesis concludes
                with a discussion of archives of media art and the technical
                possibilities for implementing them.
              </p>
              <p>
                The examination of the demos is the central part of this thesis
                and uses the methodology of text analysis. The appendices
                examine different options to implement new media art archives
                enumerating their advantages and disadvantages. The final case
                study documents the development of a demo archive programmed for
                this thesis.
              </p>
              <p>
                Why are computer demos important objects to study in art
                history? Many so-called "bedroom coders" in the 1980s emerged
                from the demoscene, i.e., young programmers who started writing
                software at the start of the home computer revolution from their
                bedrooms before they had actual offices.<sup

                  ></sup
                >
                This led to many individual careers not only in the areas of
                software development, but also in other areas of science,
                technology, engineering, and math (STEM).
              </p>
              <p>
                Music created in the early demoscene became the foundation for
                an aesthetic called chip music or chip tunes, where musicians
                choose to write their music the style of old video games. This
                form and practice have long been a vivid area of experimentation
                in the fringes of new media art, but in the past few years has
                found its way into the mainstream as a retro-aesthetic, e.g., in
                Hollywood movies such as
                <em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em> (2010) and
                <em>Thor: Ragnarok</em> (2017). Furthermore, many musicians and
                DJs in the 1990s emerged from the demoscene or were inspired by
                it.<sup

                This is particularly true for the vivid techno music scene of
                mid 1990s Germany, but also as recently as Kanye West, who wrote
                his first music on a "tracker" on the Commodore Amiga.<sup

                In essence, computer demos are the definition of new media art
                on the edge of technology. They expose and break the engineering
                constraints of emergent media.

                The Historic Developments and Achievements in the Years 1987 -

              </h3>
              <p>
                In demo history, the era before the mid-1990s is referred to as
                "old school" (or "oldskool" as it is also referred to in the

                >). The chosen scope of this thesis falls in the middle of this
                "old school" time period. Why are these particular years
                important for the Atari ST demoscene?
              </p>
              <p>
                The year 1987 saw the release of the first demo for the Atari
                ST, created by The Exceptions. There had been demos on other
                systems before, but overall, the demoscene was in its infancy.
                In this first year, The Exceptions released two more demos and
                continued their productive streak into 1988. This was the year
                an editor from the German magazine
                <em>ST-Magazin 68000er</em> befriended and persuaded them to
                reveal their coding tricks in a series of articles. Not only did
                this turn them from an insider group into minor celebrities in
                the hobbyist computer scene of the Atari ST, but it also had
                three important effects:

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Even though The Exceptions did not use their real names in
                  articles and only went by their cracker handles, they were now
                  exposed to a much wider audience, accelerating their
                  separation from the cracker scene, and they turned "legit,"
                  solely as creators of demos. This, in turn, advanced their
                  plans to become game developers.<sup

                  The exposure of demos as a concept and the demos created by
                  The Exceptions, including all the tricks, processes, and
                  methods they used, had an inspirational effect on other coders
                  and would-be coders. The inner workings and intricacies of a
                  demo were laid bare, and all the audience had to do was to
                  work hard enough to understand and replicate them to create
                  demos. If the German-speaking demoscene was not already born,
                  then this was its metaphoric birth. Numerous individual
                  demo-makers and demo-groups also started creating demos for
                  the Atari ST.<sup

                  The Exceptions and the Atari ST demoscene that was inspired
                  from them organized the first demo parties for the system with
                  the
                  <em>ST News International Christmas Coding Convention</em>
                  (STNICC) in 1990. There had been many copy parties where
                  cracked games were shared, but STNICC was the first party
                  completely devoted to demo-making.<sup

              <p>
                By 1989, The Exceptions started to team up with other
                demo-groups like
                <em>DeltaForce</em> and <em>The CareBears</em> (TCB) to form the
                <em>Union.</em> This year saw the release of the first major
                megademo for the Atari ST, a form of demo particular to this
                system; the Union broke most of the ST's technical limits in
                their Union Demo.
              </p>
              <p>
                In these three short years, the Atari ST demoscene evolved from
                the efforts of a tightly knit group to a union of multiple
                demo-groups, culminating in what can be clearly identified as a
                pre-web network of demo-makers by 1989... even though they did
                not know it at the time.

                Standing on the Shoulders of Giants: Prior Academic Research
              </h3>
              <p>
                The demoscene as a field of academic study is relatively young;
                yet several definitive works exist already. These writings by
                academics, such as Doreen Hartmann, Daniel Botz, Lassi Tasajrvi,
                and Markuu Reunanen, are astoundingly comprehensive and
                insightful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Hartmann's doctoral thesis was published in book form as
                <em>Digital Art Natives.</em> Botz's
                <em>Kunst, Code und Machine,</em> together with Tasajrvi's
                <em>Demoscene: The Art of Real-time</em> and Reunanen's
                licentiate thesis
                <em>Computer Demos - What Makes Them Tick?</em> are masterful
                exemplars of academic research cast in eloquent writing. They
                are one of the reasons for beginning the journey to write a
                master's thesis on this topic, albeit in a micro-analytic
                manner, swapping their breadth for the details of a specific
                scene for analysis.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is one aspect that ties the quite different works of
                Hartmann, Botz, Tasajrvi, and Reunannen together. Out of the
                necessity to describe and analyze a new area of research, their
                work is admirably overarching, defining the ground rules for
                further research and finding and determining the historic
                principles from the perspective of the latter-day 2000s and the
                mature demoscene. By then, the demoscene had established its
                formal structure.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Atari ST demoscene, while immensely productive and
                inspirational, never produced a number of demos as vast as the
                scene around the Commodore machines, therefore research in this
                area has always been limited. Seminal literature on the Atari ST
                has only recently been published. Marco A. Breddin wrote a
                trilogy of oral history books that he calls

                Breddin does not limit his works to the demoscene; he delivers
                an exemplary undertaking of describing the Atari ST development,
                gaming, music, and software scene over a ten-year period ranging
                from the early days of the Atari ST through the release of the
                TT workstation, the expanded Atari STE, the phenomenal Atari
                Falcon 32-bit computer, and the Atari Jaguar video game system,
                until the Atari Corporation went out of business in the
                mid-1990s.

                In the past few years, the study of demos has shifted towards
                more detail-oriented research. In her article
                <em>Demo Age: New Views,</em> Digital Humanities researcher
                Canan Hastik analyzed the type and frequency of effects in
                demos.<sup

                She applied methods established by the esteemed media scholar
                Lev Manovich to analyze digital art by distilling multiple
                individual frames of a sequence into a single image. Manovich

                The demoscene is one of many manifestations of hacker culture.
                In this context, it is tempting to explore seminal works on
                hackers; for example, the exciting accounts of the ingenious,
                the illuminating, and the strange, such as Bruce Sterling's
                hilarious

                explore the dark side of the early days of information

                by Edwin Black, first published in 2001 and rereleased in an
                expanded edition in 2012. Black recounts the sad and enraging
                tale of how pre-computing tabulation machines were used by the
                criminal Nazi regime in World War II Germany to analyze,
                catalog, and ultimately decimate whole populations on an
                industrial level. But while these historic stories are
                engrossing as well as disturbing, a deeper examination would go
                far beyond the scope of a master's thesis devoted to a specific
                demoscene.

                Demo-makers were part of the open-source movement and culture as
                it emerged in the early 1990s. The ground-breaking works on open
                and free software by Richard Stallman would apply here, and Eric
                S. Raymond's
                <em>The Cathedral and the Bazaar.</em> The downright delightful
                <em>Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age</em> by
                Paul Graham cannot be recommended enough; it discusses not only
                open source, but also the tension between creativity and coding.
                A tension that particularly underlies software-based new media
                art.

              <p>
                Demo-makers are digital artists creating algorithmic art using
                the same tools and the same general-purpose computers used in
                business, gaming, and research. Like their predecessors in the
                past, demo-makers today still explore the capabilities of
                computer hardware to learn how to leverage it to produce art.
                They are a subculture of new media artists aligned with the
                description in
                <em>Digital Art through the Looking Glass</em> by Oliver Grau

                Standing on the shoulder of these giants, this thesis explores a
                specific history, the Atari ST demoscene, and the most important
                demo-group of the system's early years, The Exceptions. By
                exploring this clearly demarcated area of research, this thesis
                attempts to do what other works of research have only seldom
                achieved: an in-depth and detailed examination of specific
                manifestations and works of the early days of a small part of
                the demoscene to offer a conclusion of general validity by
                revealing how limitations affect and propel artists.

                Music trackers are sound and music applications that allow
                musicians to address each track individually and play music
                modules and sound samples on them. Trackers were popularized in
                16-bit video game and the early demoscene. See
