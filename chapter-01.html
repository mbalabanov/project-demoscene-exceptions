              We start on the journey through demo history to discover the
              meaning of limitations in the creative process. This section
              covers the demoscene's pending international recognition as the
              first item of digital cultural heritage, its importance in
              computing history and its origins in the cracker scene. In
              further delves into the role of demos in new media art as
              digital folklore and the definition of limitations. Finally,
              this section concludes with an overview of online collections
              and archives of demo art.

            <h3 class="mt-5">1.1 Demos as Cultural Heritage</h3>
            <p>
              At the start of 2020, activists from the <em>Art of Coding</em>
              initiative made a remarkable effort to list the demoscene as the
              first digital culture item on UNESCO's list of Intangible
              Cultural Heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Two independent efforts in the demoscene showed first successes.
              In April 2020, an initiative in Finland achieved that the
              government included the demoscene on their national UNESCO list
              of intangible cultural heritage of humanity.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-14" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-14">[14]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              On their website, Andreas Lange and Tobias Kopka, the initiators
              of the campaign "Art of Coding," describe the mission of their
              initiative as:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              "The Demoscene, which is born at the heart of the home computer
              revolution, has been showing how skills and creativity can be
              stimulated and implemented in a dynamic cultural practice
              adopted to digital contexts. Many of its techniques and mindsets
              became core techniques and influences of the digital change and
              are still vibrant today. Seven decades after the invention of
              computers we think it's time to push for the next step to take
              born-digital culture seriously as part of our cultural heritage,
              starting an initiative to bring the demoscene onto the list of
              the UNESCO intangible world cultural heritage. So we invite all
              sceners and non-sceners to join us and support the initiative in
              the upcoming years."<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-15" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-15">[15]</a></sup>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Together with the increased research interest in the field of
              Media Art Histories, the initiative's success in Finland thus
              far is an official legitimization of the demoscene as inherent
              digital art and digital culture. While demos are a part of the
              larger area of media art and digital arts, only the
              well-connected and networked nature of the demoscene has made it
              possible to promote them specifically as the very first digital
              culture to be considered for inclusion on the UNESCO list of
              Intangible Cultural Heritage.
            </p>
            <p>
              Barely a week after the success in Finland, the "Art of Coding"
              initiative in Germany (represented through the Cologne-based
              <em>Digital Kultur e.V.)</em> successfully nominated the
              demoscene as a digital cultural form of heritage in the most
              populous German province of North Rhine-Westphalia. This is one
              of the necessary steps for a nomination to proceed on a federal
              level and, following that, an official request by the Federal
              Republic of Germany to UNESCO.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-16" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-16">[16]</a></sup><sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-17" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-17">[17]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              These official acts of legitimization stem from the established
              institutions of mainstream culture. Only active lobbying by a
              group can achieve this kind of recognition. In contrast to other
              digital art cultures, the demoscene learned to collaborate to
              pursue common goals early in its existence. The scene has been,
              and will continue to be, one of the many engines of a much
              larger movement: the open-source software (OSS) movement. It is
              not an inherent requirement for demo-makers to share code and
              the "secrets" of the hacks used to achieve certain effects or
              break specific limits, but it has become a common practice in
              the demoscene. Many share their code on the version control
              service <em>Github</em> under a Creative Commons license so that
              others can not only learn from and appropriate it, but also
              marvel at its ingenuity.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-18" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-18">[18]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              The ethos of early demo-makers anticipated the later open-source
              movement, with the idea that the machine they own should be
              completely controlled by the developers and all its capabilities
              should be discovered and used. This made the demoscene the first
              widespread computer art movement in computing history.

            <p>
              Demos and the demoscene are a small but important part of home
              computing history. In contrast to the top-down approach of
              computer science in industry and academia, demos exemplify the
              "grassroots" approach of the home computer revolution. When the
              home computer democratized access to information processing
              technology in the late 1970s and early 1980s, they delivered a
              completely new instrument to the households of the day.

              With the right software, users could compose professionally
              typed letters in a word processor, create business graphics,
              balance their checkbooks, and do many other tasks that would
              have required help from other professionals. Furthermore,
              computers provided entertainment with their games. There were
              "shoot 'em up" games, text adventure games, martial arts
              fighting games, jump-and-run games, gambling games, and many
              more. But all of these had to be purchased in addition to the
              computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 1980s, these affordable home computers did not do
              much on their own, except for one <em>very</em> important thing:
              users could <em>program</em> them. To this day, the fact that a
              user can develop programs on the actual computer system is the
              distinguishing feature between a general-purpose computer and a
              closed, curated system like a smartphone or a game console. To
              this day, developers can only write software for "walled garden"
              systems like Apple's iOS, Google's Android, Microsoft's Xbox,
              and Sony's Playstation using other computers (see
              <a href="chapter-03.html#circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-section-5">3.5 Computing Since the Days of The Exceptions</a>
              for more on the current day perspective).
            </p>
            <p>
              Up until the mid-1980s, most home computers came with a version
              of the programing language BASIC built into their read-only
              memory. This slow but easy-to-learn language gave early users
              their very first taste of programming. And more, the programming
              language gave them the first empowering experience of
              accomplishment on a computer. They could write their own
              programs to manage recipes, a wedding guest list, crunch numbers
              for a puzzle game, or anything else they could think of and had
              the time to write the programs for.
            </p>
            <p>
              Early programmers were only limited by their imagination, and by
              the technical limits of the early home computers. And these
              limits were very restrictive; home computers were equipped with
              very little memory, even by the standards of the day, had
              limited sound and music capabilities, and restricted colors and
              screen resolution that they could render images in. These
              limitations were a necessity to keep costs down and make the
              machines affordable to buyers who, at the time, only had a vague
              idea of what they might even do with this new class of device.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some users learned to write programs that pushed the limits of
              these computers. They graduated from BASIC to other programming
              languages, some even to the more processor-native
              <em>assembler</em>
              language. Some coders even found ways to exceed the limitations;
              to break them and force the computer to display graphics and
              produce music or sound effects that even the manufacturers had
              not thought possible. They demonstrated what their machines were
              capable of, and in turn, demonstrated what they were capable of
              as a programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              These few talented developers, usually hobbyists, were not
              satisfied with knowing all the capabilities of their computers
              and how to program them. They knew that, in the right hands, the
              hardware was more capable than was apparent. They used
              programming tricks and the most precise timing in the hardware
              processing cycles to conjure effects that even experts thought
              impossible. They created effects with real-time graphics
              whizzing across the screen, sampled sounds and multichannel
              music pulsating out of the speakers, and special effects that
              looked like they would make the hardware melt.
            </p>
            <p>These developers created demos.</p>
            <p>
              This is their story, the story of the coders from the demoscene
              that shattered the technical limits of home computers.
            </p>
            <h4>
              1.2.1 The Emergence of the Demoscene from Hardware Limitations
            </h4>
            <p>
              Nowadays, the limitations imposed on demos are by choice and by
              consensus, which has not always been the case. In the 1980s, the
              limitations were a function of the capabilities of computers of
              the day. The hardware was limited in memory, storage, processor
              speed, graphics capabilities, music, and sound effects.
            </p>
            <p>
              The 8-bit home computers of the 1980s, such as the Commodore 64,
              Sinclair ZX Spectrum, the Atari 8-bit line (XL/XE), the Amstrad
              CPC, and the Japanese MSX machines, usually had around 48 to
              128KB of RAM and their processor speeds ranged from 1MHz to
              3.5MHz, depending on the CPU architecture (based on the
              processors called MOS 6502 or the Zilog Z80). Typical screen
              resolutions ranged from 160 x 200 pixels to around 320 x 200
              pixels. To put these specifications in perspective: a single
              icon on the home screen of an iPhone has a resolution of 256 x
              256 pixels.
            </p>
            <p>
              The graphics on these old machines also had color restrictions.
              Most had a total of 16 colors available, but you could not use
              them freely. For instance, on the ZX Spectrum, you could only
              use two colors in an 8 x 8 block of pixels. The Commodore 64 was
              a bit more flexible, being able to display four colors in 4 x
              8-pixel blocks in the low-resolution color graphics mode. While
              the Commodore 64 had an arcade-quality synthesizer sound chip,
              the original ZX Spectrum had a mono beeper. Even alarm clocks
              often had better sound than the first models of the ZX Spectrum.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Amstrad CPC line and the Atari 8-bit XL/XE line were more
              flexible with their graphics. The Amstrads had low-resolution
              color graphics with vibrant colors and few restrictions on the
              use of the colors. Beyond that, they even provided higher
              resolution graphics with a few colors for word processing and
              other business applications. In this mode, they provided 80
              columns of text out of the box. This was the "holy grail" for
              business applications in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The
              8-bit Atari's had a comparatively large palette of colors,
              providing a total of 128 colors to choose from, but only around
              16 were useable at the same time.

            <p>
              Programmers, graphic artists, and sound artists had to learn to
              work within these constraints. For the first few years, the
              commercially available games and applications for these
              computers were as pedestrian as you might expect. But some
              developers had greater ambitions; they learned to fully
              understand the hardware of these comparatively simple machines.
              They experimented and discovered ways to trick the hardware into
              exceeding the previous limits. Games and applications started to
              look, sound, and <em>feel</em> much more advanced than they had
              any right to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              The next generation of machines, the 16-bit computers, were
              released in the mid-1980s, shortly after the launch of the
              "almighty" IBM PC compatibles. Starting with the Apple Macintosh
              and the Sinclair QL, followed by the Atari 520ST and the
              Commodore Amiga, these computers had a variation of the Motorola
              68000 CPU running at 7 - 8 MHz. The base models came with 128KB
              of RAM, but most were only usable if they had 512KB of RAM.
              Priced at over US-$ 2500, both the Apple Macintosh and the IBM
              PC were squarely targeted at the high-end market, and the other
              16-bit machines were priced and marketed as the next generation
              of home computers. Like the Macintosh, both the Amiga and the
              Atari ST came with a mouse. Their operating systems had icons,
              windows, and menus just like the operating systems we use today.
              Of course, they were not as refined, but the trajectory to
              today's user interface paradigms was established. The 16-bit
              computers even started to support expensive peripherals that
              only a few private individuals could afford, but businesses
              needed, like hard disks and a second monitor.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Apple Macintosh made great strides in education, graphics,
              desktop publishing, and some areas of business, but offered
              fewer games than on other systems, and little-to-no demos in the
              first years. The Atari ST and particularly the Commodore Amiga
              looked and sounded like the video game cabinets in the arcades;
              their lush color graphics and ample memory made them ideal for
              gaming and, by extension, for demos.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though this new generation of machines were more advanced,
              they were still simple enough that diligent and talented
              developers could learn <em>all</em> aspects of the hardware, and
              <em>all</em> the tricks of the trade to eke out the last bits of
              performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              Attaining this level of competence was not easy; it demanded
              expertise. Most developers never achieved the mastery necessary
              to completely exhaust the hardware's potential. Even so, these
              machines had ample performance to provide great results.

              1.2.2 The Persistence of the Demoscene Through Deliberate
              Limitations
            </h4>
            <p>
              Today, programmers, musicians, and graphic artists in the
              demoscene deliberately set limits on the size or scope of the
              demos they write. Creators of these audio-visual presentations
              choose to adopt limitations, such as limits in the size of the
              program or the number of lines of code that it can occupy at
              most, and then they produce the most ingenious, dazzling, and
              impressive art possible within these restrictions. They do not
              regard restrictions as a disadvantage, but rather as a challenge
              to show their complete command of a computer's graphics and
              sound within strict boundaries.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nowadays, demo-makers meet at demo parties; large get-togethers
              of like-minded developers in locations that can host hundreds.
              At demo-parties, like the annual <em>Revision,</em>
              <em>Evoke,</em> <em>Nordlicht,</em> and <em>Nova,</em> the
              organizers set challenges with deliberate limitations.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-19" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-19">[19]</a></sup>
              Competing participants must adhere to these restrictions and
              produce interesting and innovative graphics, sound, music, and
              effects within the chosen constraints. A jury of peers then
              picks the winner, and awards are handed out in different
              categories. The winners often do not receive valuable prizes;
              rather, the reward of gaining the admiration of their peers is
              what drives them. The limitations imposed are based on the
              developer. Graphics artists might, for example, be limited in
              the number of colors they can use in their images or the
              resolution and size of the whole image or of specific objects,
              sometimes with only 32 color shades, or using a canvas smaller
              than most icons on a modern-day smartphone. Musicians might be
              limited to a specific number of concurrent music channels, with
              as few as three electronic instrument voices being a possible
              restriction. Developers are also limited by the memory available
              to them to be inventive; typical size constraints are, for
              instance, a maximum of 4KB of storage (yes, these are
              <em>kilobytes).</em> At other demo parties and in different
              categories of a competition, the storage restriction might be a
              bit more generous, at 64KB.

              Try a little experiment, for example launch Microsoft Word, open
              a new document, and save it as it is, devoid of any words. Then,
              open a file browser, seek out the file just saved, and look at
              the document properties to determine the file size. That empty
              file will already occupy around a dozen kilobytes without any
              actual content in it. These are the kinds of constraints that
              demo-makers choose to work within.
            </p>
            <p>
              The idea behind these experiments is that adding constraints and
              limits boosts creativity. Modern computers are very developed in
              their graphics and sound capabilities, but at the same time,
              seemingly limitless in that they require large teams of
              developers, artists, and even project managers to produce
              impressive results. The sheer number of possibilities can be
              staggering, mind-boggling, and, ultimately, paralyzing. By
              embracing "creativity through limitation," digital demo artists
              avoid being overwhelmed with the possibilities. The
              clearly-defined limitations provide a laser-sharp focus on
              delivering something spectacular.

              Computer demos evolved out of the cracker and software piracy
              scene. If you wanted to pirate a copy-protected game or
              application, you needed to remove the copy protection. This was
              no trivial task, and it became harder and more complicated over
              the years as software publishers invented more sophisticated
              protections.

              Crackers who had successfully removed the copy protection on a
              piece of software were proud of their achievement and wanted to
              boast and seek out the recognition that they had bested large
              software makers. Hence, they added screens to the games showing
              off their pirate handle, their codename; of course, the crackers
              did not use their real names (<a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-7">figure 7</a>). Over time, the intro screens started to become elaborate.
              They evolved into graphics screens accompanied by music,
              boasting and bragging about how the crackers had "stuck it to
              the man." The "man," of course, being the commercial software
              producers and game publishers who would do their best to protect
              their commercially distributed software from copying and to
              actively prevent what the crackers did: make the software freely
              available for anyone to copy (see
              <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-8">figure 8</a>).

            </p>

            <p>
              Like a bloody 70s slasher movie, an explosive 80s muscle action
              movie, or a slushy 90s romantic comedy, intros had their tropes:
              their typical components. Most crackers considered the most
              important element of their intros to be their
              <em>logo,</em> which was either the logo of their group or of
              the individual cracker. The more effects or animation added to
              the logo, the better. The letters of the logo could be circling
              around on the screen or be composed of other objects. They might
              be transparent or in three dimensions or individually spinning
              and rotating, as though their life depended on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The logo was usually supplemented by many greetings. These were
              nods to other crackers in the scene, to demo-makers, or to games
              developers. The greetings either scrolled across part of the
              screen or appeared on separate screens. They could go on for a
              long time and were a central part of the intros (or
              <em>cracktros,</em>
              as the intros of cracked software would retroactively be named).
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from distributing cracked software, crackers regarded the
              greetings as a sign of respect and thus, as currency. Some
              scrolling texts had their own fonts, meticulously crafted by
              crackers with graphics skills. In their messages, they not only
              sent out greetings and kudos, but also subjectively handed out
              the titles "lamers" and "losers," to anyone they did not like,
              and attacked them. Attacks were directed towards heads of state
              like Ronald Reagan, other dignitaries like the Pope, or simply
              the owners of a particular computer system the crackers did not
              like. Just as the whole intro was a canvas for self-expression,
              crackers expressed themselves in the scrolling texts and wrote
              whatever was on their mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the computers with advanced sound capabilities for the time
              still sounded like synthesizers, hence the music accompanying
              the intros was futuristic and mystical with a focus on beats.
              Some intros use sound samples in their music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crackers gave no consideration to aesthetic principles; the more
              brash, pompous, and louder, the better. Crackers wanted to show
              that they were edgy. After all, they distributed their intros on
              pirated games. Since this was illegal, they considered
              themselves to be living dangerously.
            </p>
            <p>
              The graphic screens derived their imagery from many different
              sources, the most obvious being computer game art or the title
              graphics of games. Some images were directly lifted from pop
              culture. Crackers felt the need to be "radical" in a juvenile
              sense, e.g., using dragons, werewolves, spaceships, alien
              monsters, skulls, or any other image from movies, comics, or
              role-playing games.

            </p>

            <p>
              Some crackers developed such a level of artistry in their intros
              that the games themselves looked bland by comparison. While
              cracked software continued to be distributed with an intro, more
              elaborate intros became stand-alone applications without a
              pirated game attached. Thus, demos were born.
            </p>
            <p>
              These demos served no purpose other than to dazzle the beholder
              and to demonstrate the programming capabilities of their
              creators. The objective was to be as impressive as possible, and
              demo-makers did not achieve this by merely doing what other
              coders had done before them. What better way to demonstrate
              their capabilities than by programming graphics and sound that
              were never seen before?
            </p>
            <p>
              In his article <em>Elektronische Graffiti,</em> Roland Bader
              compared intros and cracktros with graffiti.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-23" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-23">[23]</a></sup>
              He drew parallels between sprayers and crackers; both were
              "underground" countercultures strongly defined by their
              illegality. Graffiti artists in the 80s sprayed on public and
              private property, on freight trains and passenger trains. The
              police regarded their work as "defacing", and thus
              <em>damaging</em> the property of others. Both sprayers and
              crackers had acquired specialized skills and sought out the
              respect of their peers. Both scenes had a similar aesthetic:
              edgy and slightly trashy.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the aesthetic between crackers and sprayers may have been
              related, the actual act of creation could not have been more
              different. Crackers essentially sat at a computer and broke the
              copy protection of software, and intro- and demo-makers sat at a
              computer and created the graphics, sound, and code for their
              demos. They distributed their pirated software on Bulletin Board
              Systems (BBS) or by physically copying the disks and passing
              them on to others. They did not cause any
              <em>physical</em> damage, contrary to sprayers. The possible
              impact to sales for software manufacturers were the only damage,
              and perhaps minor damage to the reputation of said
              manufacturers. Cracking was illegal, but it was not physically
              dangerous, aside from a lack of physical exercise. Cracking
              software and creating intros and demos were inert and ponderous
              acts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Illegally spraying on a property could very well be dangerous.
              Climbing a train or a roof in the night was physically
              dangerous, especially when carrying the gear necessary for
              graffiti, including cans of spray paint, stencils, and
              protective gear. Spraying on the yards of train stations could
              be dangerous, as unexpected trains could appear any time. In
              some cases, sprayers trespassed on guarded property with
              security personnel. This had the potential to escalate into
              violence.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both scenes had a similar language, their own vernacular with
              <em>handles,</em> <em>greetz,</em> <em>respect</em> and
              <em>kudos,</em> <em>disses,</em> and <em>blames.</em><sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-24" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-24">[24]</a></sup>
              Both thrived on the respect gained for their achievements.
              Sprayers and crackers chose their own names and created their
              own identity beyond their everyday lives. Both scenes were built
              on meritocracy, and both did things adults out there "just don't
              get!"
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, the conclusion is that tribalism was a defining factor of
              these scenes. They formed groups that worked together. In their
              respective groups, sprayers, crackers, and demo-makers exchanged
              skills and taught each other their craft. They competed with
              other groups. Some sprayers regarded parts of the city as their
              territory. Some crackers and demo-makers regarded the computer
              systems they used as their territory and would defend it in
              their intros and demos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demo group examined in the following chapter, The
              Exceptions, emerged from the cracker scene. They garnered
              attention with their first few intros, and created their first
              real demo on the computer of their choice, the Atari ST. This
              was their tribe's territory, and you could be sure they were out
              to defend it.

              1.4 "The Desire to Do the Impossible": Demos as Digital Folklore
            </h3>
            <p>
              In his 2008 talk at the
              <em>Hack Act Interact Progress</em> (HAIP) festival in Slovenia,
              Anders Carlsson (aka Goto80) argued that the early demoscene
              lived and acted by many of the principles that were only later
              formally defined by the open-source movement.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-25" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-25">[25]</a></sup>
              This was because many of the demo-making developers later became
              part of the open-source movement. One should not underestimate
              the fact that many of the open-source movement's principles are
              <em>objectively</em> quite sound and practical in endeavors of
              non-profit-oriented networking and collaboration. Sharing
              knowledge and code achieves more sustainable results in the
              long-term than being secretive about knowledge and keeping
              source codes away from people who could learn from them and even
              improve them.

              In his effort to put the demoscene in a context, Ville-Matias

              Fascinatingly, there is a large overlap with practices of early
              rap/hip hop music and sound sampling culture as alluded to

              either wholly original or themselves also appropriated from
              other sources is commonplace.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-28" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-28">[28]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              On the one hand, sound sampling can be regarded as a form of
              rebellion against the establishment and the law with the
              arguably victimless crime of copyright infringement, very much
              the territory of youth culture over the decades.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-29" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-29">[29]</a></sup>
              On the other hand, it is a cultural practice going back
              millennia; the oral tradition of telling and retelling folk
              stories and fairy tales, reinterpreting known melodies, changing
              the lyrics of songs, appropriating classical literary works, and
              adapting them to a different medium, changing them in the
              process.<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-30" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-30">[30]</a></sup>

              acquiring new knowledge is an act of imitation on the outset
              that propels the mind into a new gear and gradually jettisons,
              or at least reduces, imitation in favor of true understanding
              and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anders Carlsson (Goto80) argued in his talk at HAIP that demos
              are a <em>craft</em> and not <em>art</em> because they are made
              to show off and win a competition. This holds true for parts of
              the current-day demoscene that develop demos to compete at
              demo-parties. There is no way to overstate the massive impact
              that demo-parties have had on the creation of demos, the
              cohesion of the scene, and the innovations achieved in only a
              few days of working together. But demos can also be created
              completely outside of demo-parties and do not need to be created
              to win a competition. And even if so, a significant portion of
              today's output in mainstream art is created in and for
              competitions, be that architecture, film, or music. To be fair,
              showing off has always been one of the many motivations to
              create art, making it difficult to disqualify demos as art just
              because they were created to show off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anders Carlsson modifies his argument in his article
              <em>The Working Class of Computer Art?,</em> in which he
              interestingly finds vital similarities.
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "What artists and sceners share though is the desire to do the
              impossible. There is an obsession with transgression in the new
              media art world too (going beyond the 'system'), but the
              demoscene is so much ahead of everybody else that nobody gets
              it."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Carlsson calls it "transgression," while some demo-makers would
              call it shattering the limits. He then compromises by saying:
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>"I think that the scene is interesting to art people too.
                Interesting. But not relevant"</em>
              and
              <em>"Demos are more like folk culture, than 'high culture.'"</em>
              Carlsson finally resigns by remarking,
              <em>"The demoscene is the eternal underdog of computer art"</em>
              and describes the low-level work done by sceners in the
              technology sector that directly benefits media art production.
              Accordingly, the demoscene is the
              <em>"working class of art."</em>
            </p>
            <p>
              In the comments to Carlsson's article, artist and demo-maker
              Dragan Espenshied makes the argument:
            </p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "The difference between art and the demoscene is mostly that art
              contextualizes itself outside of the scene of artists. Art
              strives to be meaningful beyond itself."<sup><a id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-origin-01-33" href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-1-footnote-01-33">[33]</a></sup>
            </blockquote>
            <p>To this comment, Anders Carlsson replies:</p>
            <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
              "Couldn't it be argued that new media art has the same kind of
              problematic relationship to art, as the demoscene has to new
              media? There was a small hype for computer art/music in the 60's
              but in the 70's it cooled off and in the 80's it became
              commercial ... Media art still hasn't been accepted and
              normalized into the art world, and tends to talk too much about
              technology."
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Consequently, we can close this discussion by accepting the
              wider notion of art in which demos are an integral part of art
              making. They might not be high art or part of the established
              art community but are at least digital folk art and digital
              folklore. Like media art, they are held back by constant
              discussions about technology, which bores a mainstream audience
              because they cannot find any points of identification or
              societal relevance. Contrarily, there is a niche audience of the
              demoscene itself that revels in technical details and
              <em>wants</em> to talk about technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, their discussions about technology are less about its
              ethics and rather about the process and the techniques used to
              achieve certain results and effects.

            <p>
              Limitations are external to art and to the artist. Not everyone
              who pursues an endeavor may encounter these challenges. Rather,
              they are restrictions imposed by the laws of nature, the laws of
              a country or government, or technical limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are the color that you need but cannot find, the sound you
              hear in your head but cannot produce with the instruments you
              have, the thoughts you want to express but are silenced by
              authority. They are the space you need to create but cannot
              find.
            </p>
            <p>
              Limitations are much more concrete where computer demo art is
              concerned. Particularly, in the early days of the home computer
              revolution, computers were not very capable. They had memory
              restrictions, displayed their graphics in strange ways, and
              produced unappealing sounds. It took an artist, programmer or
              musician who really knew how to handle the hardware limitations
              to conjure beauty out of the machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demoscene has instrumentalized limitations as means to
              generate creative solutions and as a motivation. They have
              "weaponized" an aspect of human ingenuity: to see a set of
              limitations and at first be taken aback, say they are impossible
              to overcome, but then through hard work, creativity, and
              sometimes blind luck, nevertheless find means to overcome the
              limitations or, in the least, make them no longer matter.

              The demoscene's history spans forty years of intros, cracktros
              and demos on dozens of historic computer systems, ranging from
              the early days on the Apple II in the late 1970s to the sheer
              explosion of the home computer revolution in the 1980s. It
              includes machines such as the Commodore 64 in the USA and
              mainland Europe, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Amstrad
              CPC in the United Kingdom, and the venerable Commodore Amiga in
              the UK, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries.

            <p>
              There are many archives and collections for specific machines
              like the vibrant scene around the Sinclair ZX Spectrum at
              <a href="http://zxdemo.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://zxdemo.org</a>. However, the most valuable resources on the internet for
              demos on all systems are the two largest demo archives:
              <a href="http://www.pouet.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.pouet.net</a>
              and

            </p>
            <p>
              The first, the French <em>pouet.net,</em> is the demoscene's
              memory, listing and archiving historic and "old school" demos on
              legacy systems like the Commodore 64, the Atari 8-bit line, and,
              of course, the dynamic duo of the Commodore Amiga and the Atari
              ST, among many others. Pouet catalogs historic demos, providing
              dates of creation and the memory footprint of the demos (see
              <a href="circuits-ablaze-figure-11">figure 11</a>). Where
              possible, you can download the original executable files and
              even provide links to recordings of the demos on YouTube.

              The wildly popular Commodore 64, released in 1982, probably has
              the most active demoscene for an 8-bit computer. Its dedicated
              graphics hardware with sprites and hardware scrolling are among
              its great strengths, but the sensational
              <em>Sound Interface Device,</em> or <em>SID,</em> sound chip is,
              to this day, a favorite among demo music and chiptune creators.
              The archive of C64 demos can be found at
              <a href="http://www.c64.ch/demos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.c64.ch/demos/</a>.

              There are many more resources and collections of demos,
              including the MSX scene in Japan, the Eastern European demoscene
              around the Atari 8-bit line (XE/XL), and the ZX Spectrum-clones
              and imitations that were produced in the twilight years of
              communism in the late 80s. This 8-bit machine was released in
              1982 by Sir Clive Sinclair to be as cheap as possible. It has a
              few interesting limitations, including not only its ridiculously
              limited memory, but also its color restriction, allowing only
              two colors for each 8 x 8-pixel block and a sound beeper that
              sounds offensive in the wrong hands.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another valuable resource of a different kind is the source code
              repositories of demos on <em>Github</em> at
              <a href="https://github.com/topics/demoscene" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/topics/demoscene</a>. These repositories not only store the executables of hundreds
              of classic demos, but also the original source code for many of
              them. The original source code of The Exceptions' demos is
              available on Github at
              <a href="https://github.com/ggnkua/Atari_ST_Sources/tree/master/ASM/The%20Exceptions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/ggnkua/Atari_ST_Sources/tree/master/ASM/The%20Exceptions</a>. This is part of a larger effort to preserve the source code
              of Atari ST applications and demos.
            </p>
            <p>
              While these demo-archives are a great effort in storing and thus
              salvaging demos, they are very sparse in describing and
              analyzing the demos. Therefore, there is a need for an archive
              that aims to encourage academic research and scholarly analysis
              of demo art in media art history. The appendices of this thesis
              will discuss and propose how to create an academic archive of
              demo-art and its related media.

              1.7 Conclusion: Demos as a Means of Artistic Expression Fueled
              by Popular Culture
            </h3>
            <p>
              In summary, demos are real-time computer animations with music
              and sound effects. The demoscene is a youth subculture that
              emerged from the illegal cracker scene, and gradually
              established demos as their means of artistic expression. When
              they emerged, they showcased the abilities of the demo-makers in
              exceeding the technical capabilities of home computers. Demos
              had several tropes they included in graphics screens and
              scrolling texts and manifested in bragging, greetings, and
              disrespectful messages directed at competitors. They used images
              and music either as original creations or appropriated from
              games and pop culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              Home computers in the 1980s and 1990s were limited in memory,
              graphics, and sound capabilities; each system had its own
              limitations. Demo-makers sought to prove that their system of
              choice was more capable than the manufacturer's specifications
              and equal to or more capable than other systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Demos were freely distributed, and in many cases, the
              programming techniques used to achieve the effects were shared
              freely in the demoscene.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the beginning, demos were a European phenomenon, members of
              the demoscene were geographically distributed (in these days
              before the web). Programmers, graphics artists and musicians
              worked together across country borders to create their digital
              folklore and their demos. They were also fragmented by computer
              systems: some developed for the Commodore 64, others for the
              Commodore Amiga. On the Atari ST, there was one group that
              started it all: The Exceptions.
