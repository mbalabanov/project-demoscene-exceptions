              At the start of 2020, activists from the <em>Art of Coding</em>
              initiative made a remarkable effort to list the demoscene as the
              first digital culture item on UNESCO's list of Intangible
              Cultural Heritage.

            <p>
              Two related but independent efforts in the demoscene showed the
              first successes. In April 2020, an initiative in Finland
              successfully achieved the inclusion of the demoscene on the
              federal Ministry of Education and Culture's proposals from the
              National Board of Antiquities and the Intangible Cultural
              Heritage Expert Group as national cultural heritage of humanity
              (together with eleven other cultural practices).<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-17"

              On their website, Andreas Lange and Tobias Kopka, the initiators

              adopted to digital contexts. Many of its techniques and mindsets

              starting an initiative to bring the demoscene onto the list of
              the UNESCO intangible world cultural heritage. So we invite all

              Together with the increased interest of research in the field of
              Media Art Histories, the initiative's success in Finland so far
              is an official legitimization of the demoscene as inherent
              digital art and digital culture. While demos are a part of the
              larger area of media art and digital arts, only the
              well-connected and networked nature of the demoscene has made it
              possible to promote them specifically as the very first digital
              culture to be considered for inclusion on the UNESCO list of
              Intangible Cultural Heritage.

              Barely a week after the success in Finland, the <em>Art of Coding</em>
              initiative in Germany (represented through the Cologne-based
              <em>Digital Kultur e.V.</em>) successfully nominated the demoscene as a
              digital cultural form of heritage in the most populous German
              province of North Rhine-Westphalia. This is one of the necessary
              steps for a nomination to proceed on a federal level and,
              following that, an official request by the Federal Republic of
              Germany to UNESCO.<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-19"

            <p>
              These official acts of legitimization come from the established
              mainstream culture. The demoscene has been and will continue to
              be one of the many engines of a much larger movement: the
              open-source software (OSS) movement. It is not an inherent
              requirement for demo-makers to share code and the "secrets" of
              the hacks used to achieve certain effects or break specific
              limits, but it has become a common practice in the demoscene.
              Many share their code on the version control service <em>Github</em> (<a
                href="https://github.com/topics/demoscene" target="_blank">https://github.com/topics/demoscene</a>)
              under a <em>Creative Commons</em> license so that others
              can not only
              learn from and appropriate it, but also marvel at its ingenuity.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ethos of early demo-makers anticipated the later open-source
              movement, with the idea that the machine they own should be
              completely controlled by the developers and all its capabilities
              should be discovered and used.

            <h3>1.1 Demos as Part of Computer History</h3>
            <p>
              Demos and the demoscene are part of home computer history. In
              contrast to the top-down approach of computer science stemming
              from industry and academia, demos exemplify the grassroots
              approach of the home computer revolution. When the home computer
              democratized access to information processing technology in the
              late 1970s and early 1980s, they delivered a completely new
              instrument to the households of the day.

              With the right software, interested users could compose
              professionally typed letters in a word processor, create
              business graphics, balance their checkbooks, and do many other
              tasks that would have required help from others. Furthermore,
              they provided entertainment with their games. There were shoot
              'em up games, text adventure games, martial arts fighting games,
              jump-and-run games, gambling games, and many more. But all of
              these had to be purchased in addition to the computer.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the early 1980s, these affordable home computers did not do
              much by themselves, except for one thing, one very important
              thing: Users could <em>program</em> them. To this day the fact that a
              user can develop programs using their computer is the
              distinguishing feature between a general-purpose computer and a
              closed, curated system like a smartphone or a games console (see
              <a href="chapter-04.html#limits-chapter-4-section-5">4.6 Computing Since the Days of The Exceptions</a>
              for more on the
              current day perspective).
            </p>
            <p>
              Up until the mid-1980s, most home computers came with a version
              of the programing language BASIC built into their read-only
              memory. This slow but easy-to-learn language gave early users
              their very first taste of programming. And more, they gave them
              the first empowering experience of getting things done on a
              computer. They could write their own programs to manage recipes,
              a wedding guest list, and to crunch numbers for a puzzle game or
              anything else they could think of and had the time to program.
            </p>
            <p>
              They were only limited by their imagination—and by the technical
              limits of the early home computers. And these limits were very
              restrictive. Home computers were equipped with very little
              memory, even by the standards of the day. They had limited sound
              and music capabilities. Their graphics were restricted in the
              number of colors they could display and the screen resolution
              they could render images in. These limitations were a necessity
              to keep costs down and make the machines affordable to buyers
              who, at the time, only had a vague idea of what they might even
              do with this new class of device.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some users learned to write programs that pushed the limits of
              these computers. They graduated from BASIC to other programming
              languages—some even to the more processor native <em>assembler</em>
              language. Some coders even found ways to exceed the limitations,
              to break them and make the computer display graphics and produce
              music or sound effects that even the manufacturers had not
              thought possible. They demonstrated what their machines were
              capable of, and they demonstrated what they were capable of as a
              programmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              These few talented developers, usually hobbyists, were not
              satisfied with knowing all the capabilities of their computers
              and how to program them. They knew that, in the right hands, the
              hardware was more capable than was apparent. They used
              programming tricks and the most precise timing in the hardware
              processing cycles to conjure effects that even experts thought
              impossible. And these developers wanted to demonstrate their
              skills. They created demos with real-time graphics whizzing
              across the screen, sampled sounds and multichannel music
              pulsating out of the speakers, and special effects that looked
              like they would make the hardware melt.
            </p>
            <p>These developers created <em>demos.</em></p>
            <p>
              This is their story, the story of the coders from the demoscene
              that shattered the technical limits of home computers.

              1.2 "The Desire to Do the Impossible": Demos as Digital Folklore
            </h3>
            <p>
              In his 2008 talk at the "Hack Act Interact Progress" (HAIP)
              festival in Slovenia, Anders Carlsson (aka Goto80) argues that
              the early demoscene lived and acted by many of the principles
              that were only later formally defined by the <em>open-source</em>
              movement.<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-21" href="#limits-chapter-1-footnote-01-21">[21]</a></sup>
              The reason for this was that many of the demo-making
              developers later becoming part of the open-source movement. One
              should not underestimate the fact that many of the open-source
              movement's principles are <em>objectively</em> quite sound and practical
              in endeavors of non-profit-oriented networking and
              collaboration. Sharing knowledge and code achieves more
              sustainable results in the long-term than being secretive about
              knowledge and keeping source codes away from people who could
              learn from them and even improve them.

              In his effort to put the demoscene in a context, Ville-Matias

              Fascinatingly, there is a large overlap with practices of early

              On the one hand, this can be regarded as a form of rebellion
              against the establishment and the law with the arguably
              victimless crime of copyright infringement, very much the

                  href="#limits-chapter-1-footnote-01-25">[25]</a></sup> On the other hand,
              it is a cultural practice going back millennia: the oral
              tradition of telling and retelling folk stories and fairy tales,
              reinterpreting known melodies, changing the lyrics of songs,
              appropriating classical literary works, and adapting them to a

              human activity of learning behaviors as well as acquiring new
              knowledge is an act of imitation on the outset that propels the
              mind into a new gear and gradually jettisons imitation in favor
              of true understanding and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anders Carlsson (Goto80) argued in his talk at HAIP that demos
              are <em>craft</em> and not <em>art</em> because they are made to show off and win
              a competition. This holds true for parts of the current-day
              demoscene that develop demos to compete at demo-parties. There
              is no way to overstate the massive impact that demo-parties have
              had on the creation of demos, the cohesion of the scene, and the
              innovations achieved in a few short days of getting together.
              But demos can be created completely outside of demo-parties.
              They do not need to be created to win a competition. And even if
              so, a significant portion of today's output in the mainstream
              arts is created in competitions, be that architecture, film, or
              music competitions. And to be fair, showing off was always one
              of the many motivations to create art. This makes it hard to
              disqualify demos as art just because they were created to show
              off.
            </p>
            <p>
              Anders Carlsson modifies his argument in his article <em>The
                Working Class of Computer Art?,</em> in which he interestingly finds
              vital similarities.<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-28"

              "What artists and sceners share though is the desire to do the
              impossible. There is an obsession with transgression in the new

              demoscene is so much ahead of everybody else that nobody gets

              Carlsson calls it "transgression," while some demo-makers would
              call it shattering the limits. He then compromises by saying:

            <blockquote class="alert alert-light">
              "I think that the scene is interesting to art people too.

              culture, than 'high culture.'"</blockquote>
            <p>He finally resigns by
              remarking:</p>

            <p>And he describes the low-level work done by sceners in the

            <p>
              One can conclude the discussion by saying that demos are art;
              they might not be high art or part of the established art
              community. This makes them digital folk art, digital folklore.
              Like media art, they are held back by constant discussions about
              technology. This bores a mainstream audience because they cannot
              find any points of identification or societal relevance.
              Contrarily, there is a niche audience of the demoscene itself
              that revels in technical details and <em>wants</em> to talk about
              technology.
            </p>
            <p>
              In the demoscene, the discussion about technology is not about
              its ethicality, it is about the process and the techniques used
              to achieve certain results and effects.

              The demoscene is around forty years old. These are forty years
              of intros, cracktros, and demos on dozens of historic computer
              systems, ranging from the early days on the Apple II in the late
              1970s to the sheer explosion of the home computer revolution in
              the 1980s with machines such as the Commodore 64 in the USA and
              mainland Europe, the Sinclair ZX Spectrum, BBC Micro and Amstrad
              CPC in the United Kingdom, and the venerable Commodore Amiga in
              the UK, Germany, and the Scandinavian countries.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are a large number of archives and collections like the
              pulsating scene around the Sinclair ZX Spectrum at
              <a href="http://zxdemo.org" target="_blank">http://zxdemo.org</a>, but the most valuable resources on the
              internet for actual
              demos are the two largest demo archives (<a href="http://www.pouet.net"
                target="_blank">http://www.pouet.net</a>
              and
              <a href="https://demozoo.org" target="_blank">https://demozoo.org</a>).
            </p>
            <p>
              The first of the two, the French <em>pouet.net,</em> acts as the
              demoscene's memory, listing and archiving historic and "old
              school" demos on legacy systems like the Commodore 64, the Atari
              8-bit line, and, of course, the dynamic duo, the Commodore Amiga
              and the Atari ST, among many others. <em>Pouet</em> catalogs historic
              demos, providing dates of creation and the memory footprint of
              the demos. Where possible, you can download the original
              executable files and even provide links to recordings of the
              demos on YouTube.

              This 8-bit machine was released in 1982 by Sir Clive Sinclair to
              be as cheap as possible. It has a number of interesting
              limitations. Not only its ridiculously limited memory, but it's
              also color restriction of only two colors for each 8 x 8-pixel
              block and sound beeper that sounds offensive in the wrong hands.

              The wildly popular Commodore 64 (also released in 1982) probably
              has the most active demoscene for an 8-bit computer. Its
              dedicated graphics hardware with sprites and hardware scrolling
              are among its great strengths, but the sensational <em>Sound
                Interface Device,</em> or SID, sound chip is, to this day, a favorite
              among demo music and chiptune creators. The archive of C64 demos
              can be found at
              <a hrefF="http://www.c64.ch/demos/" target="_blank">http://www.c64.ch/demos/</a>. There are many more
              resources and collections of demos,
              including the MSX scene in Japan, the Eastern European demoscene
              around the Atari 8-bit line (XE/XL), and the ZX Spectrum-clones
              and imitations that were produced in the twilight years of
              communism in the late 80s.

            <p>
              Another great resource of a different kind is the source code
              repositories of demos on Github at
              <a href="https://github.com/topics/demoscene">https://github.com/topics/demoscene</a>. These repositories
              not only store the executables of hundreds
              of classic demos but also the original source code for many of
              them. The original source code of The Exceptions' demos is

              These demo-archives are a great effort in storing and thus
              salvaging demos. They are very sparse in describing and
              analyzing the demos. There is a need for an archive that aims to
              encourage academic research and scholarly analysis of demo art
              in media art history. The appendices of this thesis will discuss
              and propose how to create an academic archive of demo-art and

            <h3>1.4 Demo-groups and Their Computer Systems of Choice</h3>
            <p>
              This master thesis focuses on computer demos on the Atari ST
              computer system, which was released in late 1985 but only found
              wide distribution in 1986 and beyond.

              It was the Atari Corporation's first foray into the market of
              16-bit home computers. Atari was among the pioneering
              manufacturers in the late 1970s and early 1980s with its 8-bit
              video game consoles and line of computers but had lost its lead
              in the consumer home market to Commodore and Apple. The Atari ST
              would introduce 16-bit computing to the masses. As then-CEO of
              Atari Jack Tramiel put it: "A computer for the masses, not the
              classes."<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-31" href="#limits-chapter-1-footnote-01-31">[31]</a></sup>
              Atari's Tramiel also proudly proclaimed that the ST
              delivered "Power without the price."<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-32"
                  href="#limits-chapter-1-footnote-01-32">[32]</a></sup>
            </p>
            <p>
              When the Apple Macintosh came with 512 kilobytes of RAM at close
              to $3000 USD, the IBM PC could not be expanded beyond 640
              kilobytes yet still cost nearly as much. The larger model of the
              original Atari ST, the 520ST+, was the first computer with a
              megabyte of RAM that retailed for $1000 USD. Each kilobyte of
              RAM cost only a dollar.
            </p>
            <p>
              After numerous less successful revisions, Atari retired their ST
              line of computers in 1993. Around this time, Atari left the home
              and personal computer market to focus on its video game efforts.

            <h3>1.5. What Are Limitations?</h3>
            <p>
              Limitations are external to art and to the artist. Not everyone
              who pursues an endeavor may encounter these challenges. Rather,
              they are restrictions imposed by the laws of nature, the laws of
              a country or government, or <em>technical</em> limitations.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are the color that you need but cannot find, the sound you
              hear in your head but cannot produce with the instruments you
              have. They are the thoughts you want to express but are silenced
              by authority. They are the space you need to create but cannot
              find.
            </p>
            <p>
              Limitations are much more concrete where computer demo art is
              concerned. Particularly, in the early days of the home computer
              revolution, computers were not very capable. They had memory
              restrictions, displayed their graphics in strange ways, and
              produced unappealing sounds. It took an artist, programmer or
              musician who really knew how to handle the hardware limitations
              to conjure beauty out of the machine.
            </p>
            <p>
              In conclusion, the demoscene has instrumentalized limitations as
              a means to generate creative solutions and as a motivation. They
              have "weaponized" an aspect of human ingenuity: To see a set of
              limitations and at first be taken aback, say they are impossible
              to overcome, but then through hard work, creativity and
              sometimes blind luck, nevertheless find means to overcome the
              limitations or – in the least – make them no longer matter.

              1980s
            </h3>
            <p>
              Computer demos evolved out of the cracker and software pirate
              scene. If you wanted to pirate a copy-protected game or
              application, you needed to remove the copy protection. This was
              no trivial task, and it became harder and more complicated over
              the years as software publishers invented ever more
              sophisticated protections.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>Crackers</em> who had successfully removed the copy protection on a
              piece of software were proud of their achievement—they wanted to
              boast and sought out the recognition that they had bested large
              software makers. Hence, they added screens to the games showing
              off their pirate handle, their codename. Of course, the crackers
              did not use their real names. Over time, the intro screens
              started to become elaborate. They evolved into graphics screens
              accompanied by music, boasting and bragging about how the
              crackers had "stuck it to the man." The "man," of course, was
              the commercial software producers and game publishers who would
              do their best to protect their commercially distributed software
              from copying and to actively prevent what the crackers did: make
              the software freely available for anyone to copy.

              )
            </p>

            <p>
              Like a bloody 70s slasher movie, an explosive 80s muscle action
              movie, or a slushy 90s romantic comedy, intros had their
              tropes—their typical components. Most crackers considered the
              most important element of their intros to be their logo. It was
              either the logo of their group or of the individual cracker. The
              more effects or animation that was added to the logo, the
              better. The letters of the logo could be circling around on the
              screen or composed of other objects. They might be transparent
              or in three dimensions or individually spinning and rotating, as
              though their life depended on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              The logo was usually supplemented by <em>greetings.</em> Many greetings.
              These were nods to other crackers in the scene, to demo-makers,
              or to games developers. The greetings either scrolled across
              part of the screen or appeared on separate screens. They could
              go on for a long time and were a central part of the intros (or
              <em>cracktros,</em> as the intros of cracked software would retroactively
              be named).
            </p>
            <p>
              Apart from distributing cracked software, crackers regarded the
              greetings as a sign of respect and thus as currency. Some
              scrolling texts had their own fonts, meticulously crafted by
              crackers with graphics skills. In their messages, they not only
              sent out greetings and kudos but also attacked "lamers" and
              "losers," subjectively handing out this title to anyone they did
              not like. Attacks were directed towards heads of state like
              Ronald Reagan, other dignitaries like the Pope, or simply the
              owners of a particular computer system the crackers didn't like.
              Just as the whole intro was a canvas for self-expression,
              crackers expressed themselves in the scrolling texts and wrote
              whatever was on their mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even the computers with advanced sound capabilities for the time
              still sounded like synthesizers, so the music accompanying the
              intros was futuristic and mystical, with a focus on beats. Some
              intros use sound samples in their music.
            </p>
            <p>
              Crackers gave no consideration to aesthetic principles—the more
              brash, pompous, and louder, the better. Crackers wanted to show
              that they were edgy. After all, they distributed their intros on
              pirated games. Since this was illegal, they considered
              themselves to be living dangerously.
            </p>
            <p>
              The graphic screens derived their imagery from many different
              sources—the most obvious source being computer game art or the
              title graphics of games. Some images were directly lifted from
              pop culture. Crackers felt the need to be "radical" in a
              juvenile sense, e.g., dragons, werewolves, spaceships, alien
              monsters, skulls, or any other image from movies, comics, or
              role-playing games.

              Some crackers developed such a level of artistry in their intros
              that the games themselves looked bland by comparison. While
              cracked software continued to be distributed with an intro, more
              elaborate intros became stand-alone applications without a
              pirated game attached. Thus, <em>demos</em> came to be.
            </p>
            <p>
              These demos served no purpose other than to dazzle the beholder
              and to demonstrate the programming capabilities of their
              creators. The objective was to be as impressive as possible.
              Demo makers did not achieve this by merely doing what other
              coders had done before them. What better way to demonstrate
              their brilliance than by programming graphics and sound that
              were never before seen?
            </p>
            <p>
              In his article <em>Elektronische Graffiti,</em> Roland Bader compared
              intros and cracktros with graffiti.<sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-33"
                  href="#limits-chapter-1-footnote-01-33">[33]</a></sup> He drew parallels between
              sprayers and crackers; both were "underground" countercultures
              strongly defined by their illegality. Graffiti artists in the
              80s sprayed on public and private property, on freight trains
              and passenger trains. The police regarded their work as
              "defacing" and thus damaging the property of others. Both
              sprayers and crackers had acquired specialized skills and sought
              out the respect of their peers. Both scenes had a similar
              aesthetic: edgy and slightly trashy.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the aesthetic may have been related, the actual act of
              creation could not have been more different. Crackers
              essentially sat at a computer and broke the copy protection of
              software. Intro- and demo-makers sat at a computer and created
              the graphics, sound, and code for their demos. They distributed
              their pirated software on Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) or by
              physically copying the disks and passing them on to others. They
              did not cause any <em>physical</em> damage. The possible impact to sales
              for software manufacturers were the only damage (and perhaps
              minor damage to the reputation of said manufacturers). Cracking
              was illegal, but it was not physically dangerous, aside from a
              lack of physical exercise. Cracking software and creating intros
              and demos were inert and ponderous acts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Illegally spraying on a property could very well be dangerous.
              Climbing a train or a roof in the night <em>was</em> physically
              dangerous, especially when carrying the gear necessary for
              graffiti, cans of spray paint, stencils, and protective gear.
              Spraying on the yards of train stations could be dangerous, as
              unexpected trains could appear any time. In some cases, sprayers
              trespassed on guarded property with security personnel who might
              not immediately recognize the sprayers as the kids they were and
              therefore, could react violently.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both scenes had a similar language, their own vernacular with
              <em>handles,</em> <em>greetz,</em> <em>respect</em> and <em>kudos,</em> <em>disses</em> and
              <em>blames.</em><sup><a id="limits-chapter-1-origin-01-34"
                  href="#limits-chapter-1-footnote-01-34">[34]</a></sup> Both
              thrived on the respect gained for their achievements. Sprayers
              and crackers chose their own names and created their own
              identity beyond their everyday lives. Both scenes were built on
              meritocracy. And both scenes were something that the adults out
              there "just don't get!"
            </p>
            <p>
              Thus, the conclusion is that tribalism was a defining factor of
              these scenes. They formed groups that worked together. In their
              respective groups, sprayers, crackers, and demo-makers exchanged
              skills and taught each other their craft. They competed with
              other groups. Some sprayers regarded particular parts of the
              city as their territory. Some crackers and demo-makers regarded
              the computer systems they used as their territory and would
              defend it in their intros and demos.
            </p>
            <p>
              The demo group examined in this thesis, The Exceptions, emerged
              from the cracker scene. They garnered attention with their first
              few intros. They created their first real demo on the Atari ST,
              their computer of choice. This was their tribe's territory. And
              they damn well were going to defend it.

            <h3>
              1.7 Conclusion: Demos as a Means of Artistic Expression Fueled
              by Popular Culture
            </h3>
            <p>
              Demos are real-time computer animations with music and a means
              of expression. The demoscene is a youth subculture that emerged
              from the illegal cracker scene. When they emerged, they
              showcased the abilities of the demo-makers in exceeding the
              technical capabilities of home computers. Demos had a number of
              tropes, like graphics screens and scrolling texts with bragging,
              greetings, and disrespectful messages directed at competitors.
              They used images and music either as original creations or
              appropriated from games or pop culture.
            </p>
            <p>
              The varied home computers in the 1980s and 1990s were limited in
              memory, graphics, and sound capabilities. Each system had its
              own limitations. Demo-makers sought to prove that their system
              of choice was more capable than the manufacturer's
              specifications and equal to or more capable than other systems.
            </p>
            <p>
              Demos were freely distributed, and in many cases, the
              programming techniques used to achieve the effects were shared
              freely in the demoscene.
            </p>
            <p>
              The members of the demoscene were geographically distributed in
              these days before the web. They created their digital folklore,
              their demos, concentrated by region, where the programmers could
              meet the graphics artists and the musicians. They were also
              fragmented by computer systems: Some developed for the Commodore
              64, other for the Commodore Amiga. On the Atari ST, there was
              one group that started it all: <em>The Exceptions</em>.
