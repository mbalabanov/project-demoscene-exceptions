              <p>
                This thesis has mapped the journey of The Exceptions from 1987
                to 1989 in order to discuss how technical limitations motivated
                the creation of demo art. The Exceptions became better
                programmers, graphics artists, and musicians by overcoming
                technical limitations. In this section the final step is taken,
                namely discussing the thesis' conclusion: limitations in art do
                not hinder its creation but rather stimulate ingenuity and
                inventiveness to push the limits.

                6.1 Breaking Limitations as the First Motivating Factor
              </h3>
              <p>
                Computer demos are a means of artistic expression as real-time
                computer animations with music. The youth subculture called the
                "demoscene" emerged from the illegal cracker scene in the 1980s,
                where demo-makers showcase their abilities in exceeding the
                technical capabilities of home computers. Members of the
                demoscene were greatly geographically distributed in these days
                before the web and were also fragmented by computer systems;
                many were developing for different computers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Each computer system in the 1980s and 1990s had its own
                limitations in memory, graphics, and sound capabilities. The
                creators of demos sought to prove that the system they chose to
                create for was more capable than the manufacturer's
                specifications. They often compared their achievements with
                other demo creators, particularly those on more capable
                machines. In many cases, they shared their programming
                techniques freely in the demoscene.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Exceptions were the first group to create demos on the Atari
                ST to prove that their machine of choice could meet the
                capabilities of the competing Commodore Amiga. Through their
                demo art, The Exceptions inspired others to create their own
                demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                As discussed in detail in the previous sections, The Exceptions
                formed in 1987 in the cracker scene and created intro screens
                for pirated games. They released their first demo, README.PRG,
                that broke the Atari ST's color limitation, producing artwork in
                more than 16 colors. They created smooth horizontal scrolling by
                with a horizontal scrolling text, something the Atari ST was
                thought not to be capable of. They established their rivalry
                with the Commodore Amiga, the technically superior machine.
              </p>
              <p>
                They taught themselves the necessary skills to produce their
                demo art. Erik Simon (ES) pixel painted, Udo Fischer (-ME-)
                programmed in Motorola 68000 assembly code, and Jochen Hippel
                (Mad Max) wrote music for the limited sound chip of the Atari
                ST. They approached the creation of their demo art from the
                craftsman's position and the technician's perspective, thus
                creating "digital folk art".
              </p>
              <p>
                In their next two demos, they produced music that was comparable
                to the superior SID chip in the Commodore 64 using ST's limited
                sound hardware: the Little Sound Demo and the Little Color Demo.
                With their demos, they reached out to a community of crackers
                and demo-makers, inspiring their peers to produce their own
                works. The same year, The Exceptions collaborated with fellow
                demo-coder Alyssa to remove the lower border of the ST's screen
                for the Super-Neo Demo Show. They were influenced by fantasy and
                science fiction films and heavily borrowed the aesthetic from
                computer games for their demos' graphics and effects. In their
                scrolling texts they used self-aggrandizing language, taking
                jabs at their peers, but were self-deprecating about their own
                work.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1988, The Exceptions peaked as demo-makers and produced the
                most demos to break the numerous hardware limitations, including
                the ST's color limits, the bottom and the right screen borders,
                and the limits of the ST's sound chip. In their B.I.G-Demo, they
                produced the longest scrolling text to date on any system.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this same year, The Exceptions were recognized outside of the
                demoscene when they published a series of programming articles
                in <em>ST-Magazin 68000er.</em> This was also the year that The
                Exceptions decided to use their acquired skills to become game
                developers and no longer create demos. The Exceptions inspired
                others in the Atari ST demoscene and passed the torch on to
                other demo-makers.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before leaving the demoscene in 1989, The Exceptions
                collaborated with other demo-groups to create the Union Demo
                that broke the last hardware limitations of the Atari ST. Using
                their inquisitiveness and ingenuity, they "tickled out" the last
                pieces of performance from the Atari ST, broke its last limits,
                and helped create a thriving demoscene on that system. They led
                the way and demonstrated what could be done, thus uniting
                demo-groups globally to produce collaborative demo art projects
                in a pre-web age.

            <section id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-6-section-3">
              <h3 class="mt-5">6.2 Reading the Absence</h3>
              <p>
                What is striking about these demos is not only what they depict,
                but also what they do not depict. Topics often examined in art,
                such as explicit political statements and messages, depictions
                of sexual content or nudity, are completely absent in these
                demos. This is due to the very nature of the demos; their main
                message was one of <em>technical exhibitionism.</em> The
                demo-makers explicitly deliver astounding technical achievements
                and brag about them.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether specifically intended or not, demo-makers have a
                socio-economic, even political, message by freely distributing
                their demo art and sharing their programming knowledge, thus
                representing early manifestations of the open-source movement.
                The music and some of the graphics do not respect the laws of
                copyright, even openly bragging at having replicated the
                commercially produced music on other computer systems. The
                images, particularly in the Super-Neo-Demo-Show, were inspired
                by commercial and copyrighted materials, meticulously replicated
                by hand in pixels. They copied the movie poster of
                <em>The Last Unicorn,</em> a painting of the dragon Smaug from
                Tolkien's <em>The Hobbit,</em> and paintings by the Hildebrandt
                brothers, commercial painters in their own right (see
                <a href="chapter-03.html#circuits-ablaze-chapter-3-section-6"
                  >3.5 Super-Neo-Demo-Show</a
                >). Hence, the demos take inspiration from consumer culture and
                propagate the free distribution of ideas without commercial
                interest.
              </p>
              <p>
                They are not alone in this; rather, without deliberately
                intending it, The Exceptions follow in the tradition of the
                artist Barbara Kruger. Like other pop-artists, Kruger
                appropriated consumerist imagery for her postmodern conceptual
                art to explore and analyze identity, sexuality, and the
                portrayal of women in the mass media, and how they are distorted
                and objectified.<sup

              </p>
              <p>
                As former members of the cracker scene, The Exceptions used
                copyrighted images from popular culture not as a means of
                criticism, but rather out of a disregard for the copyright laws,
                and a personal affection for the chosen subject matter even
                though their use was illegitimate. In the late 1980s, this
                remained unnoticed by the copyright holders due to the
                restricted distribution of the demos. In today's context, their
                use of copyrighted materials would likely qualify as "fair
                use".<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-chapter-6-origin-06-69"
                    href="#circuits-ablaze-chapter-6-footnote-06-69"
                    >[69]</a
                  ></sup
                >
              </p>
              <p>
                Though the term "open-source" had not yet found wide adoption at
                the time, The Exceptions technical solutions were open-source in
                the truest sense of the word: they invented their own routines
                and algorithms for their demos and shared the source code with
                the public (see
                <a href="chapter-04.html#circuits-ablaze-chapter-4-section-4"
                  >4.3 Mainstream Exposure</a
                >). The work is not influenced or tamed by any sponsors or
                patrons that might have financed it; thus, the work is a pure
                expression of creativity. While it can be argued that the skills
                and knowledge attained would open many possibilities for the
                creators in the lucrative field of computer programming,
                graphics, and music composition, the demos themselves are of a
                completely irreverent nature and are not pandering to any
                potential employers. They simply wanted to impress their peers
                in their subculture.

                6.3 Subculture as the Second Motivating Factor
              </h3>
              <p>
                Breaking the technical limitations was not the only motivating
                factor to produce demo art; working within a subculture was the
                second major motivating factor. Without recognition by peers,
                the efforts were nearly wasted. From their first demo, The
                Exceptions were already in a state of communication with their
                peers and their audience. By recognizing others, they laid the
                groundwork for the creation of the demoscene subculture
              </p>
              <p>
                In the mid to late 1980s, computer usage was increasing, but it
                should not be forgotten that most people did not yet regularly
                use computers, let alone own them. The notion that art could be
                produced on computers was only accepted on the fringes. Using a
                computer to create art was even regarded as an act of cheating
                because computers would "do the work for you", something that
                did not happen in traditional art techniques; a notion born out
                of a lack of understanding.
              </p>
              <p>
                By their very nature, the demos did not reach a large audience.
                Even within the group who owned computers, the demos only
                managed to reach the small group of people who owned an Atari
                ST. At first, they addressed a small group of demo-making peers,
                but the process of each demo release created a new audience,
                reaching out with each subsequent release.
              </p>
              <p>
                Being part of subculture was vital to the creation of these
                demos because it was a niche that they formed for themselves
                without any fixed rules. The Exceptions were making it up as
                they went along.

                6.4 Putting the Conclusion to the Test: Examining Limitations in
                an Art Historical Context
              </h3>
              <p>
                The conclusion of this thesis is that limitations motivate the
                creation of art. Is this applicable to other areas of art, and
                are other forms of limitation the cause for innovation and
                motivation?
              </p>
              <p>
                This section analyzes the life and works of artists from
                different eras of the 20<sup>th</sup> century to briefly examine
                how overcoming limitations has influenced their art. Henri
                Matisse, Lee Krasner and Yayoi Kusama each struggled against
                different constraints, evolving and innovating their art in the
                process.

              <h4>6.4.1 Henri Matisse and the Burdensome Weight of Illness</h4>
              <p>
                Henri Emile Benoit Matisse, one of the greatest painters of the
                early 20<sup>th</sup> century, suffered from severe health issue
                for most of his life, yet still revolutionized art. He was
                celebrated as a master draughtsman and a painter of decorative
                and colorful works ranging from conventionally attractive
                paintings in a more naturalistic style to daring paintings with
                simplified forms.<sup

              </p>
              <p>
                In 1941 at the age of 71, he underwent an emergency operation
                for intestinal cancer and survived. For most people, this would
                have been a sign that the time was right for retirement, not so
                for Matisse. Despite being mortally ill and partially confined
                to a wheelchair, he refused to let his physical limitations
                prevent him from producing art. He changed his style to fit his
                restrictions and went on to produce some of the most vibrant and
                life-affirming images of his career: The paper cutouts,
                <em>decoupage.</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                He developed this technique of cutting abstract shapes out of
                color paper and mounted them to large boards (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-77">figure 77</a>). The results
                were joyful and beautifully colored.

                The new style of his work was not immediately accepted by the
                art world, with some critics calling his work "paper jokes".
                Matisse's contemporary and "friendly rival" Pablo Picasso
                understood Matisse better than anyone else and saw the ingenuity
                in Matisse's work in his final phase. No longer able to stand in
                front of a canvas and paint, Matisse found a new boldness of
                form, simplicity, and fierce colors anticipating the Pop Art
                movement that emerged well over a decade later. At the same
                time, there is a hint of darkness in his work. He started
                creating his cutouts during the most challenging period of his
                life battling his illness and the Second World War raging.
              </p>
              <p>
                A pivotal piece of this period is the image of the mythical
                character Icarus plunging from the sky; the stark black
                silhouette of a human figure against a saturated blue background
                (see <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-78">figure 78</a>). In the
                context of the Second World War, the yellow stars surrounding
                the figure could be read as explosions of fire bursts. Even the
                abstract body of Icarus could be interpreted as a corpse.

                Yet, the predominant effect of his art is joy and relief,
                depicting circus figures like jugglers and clowns. Of course,
                Matisse could not do this alone; he had assistants that helped
                him create his art.

                <em>Henri Matisse. A Cut Above the Rest</em> in 2013, she
                described the method:

                with yellow, orange, red, green, according to his choice. Then
                he would cut these up and then afterwards I would put them up on
                the wall using needles and a small hammer."<sup

                Matisse did not stop painting immediately after the operation.
                He produced his final paintings in 1948. He <em>chose</em> to
                exclusively focus on the paper cutouts and explore the potential
                of this new medium. The cutouts started out as paintings
                "constructed" out of cutout shapes instead of brush strokes, but
                then took on an independent direction. The scale of his artwork
                increased.

                her book <em>Matisse and Picasso: A Friendship in Art</em> in
                1990, describes Matisse's process as:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Matisse was in his bed and he cut the paper with large
                scissors, he would do whatever shape he wanted. He did that very
                fast, with dynamism. In a very spontaneous manner. It was
                creation itself! He has reached a moment in his life when he was
                at one in his mind and in his body."<sup

                In 1948 Matisse created the crowning project of his twilight
                years; he built and decorated every detail of the Chapel of the
                Rosary. He designed its stained-glass windows, the interiors,
                its three murals, right down to the colorful vestments worn by
                the priest. All created with his new technique of cutouts.
                Matisse created a haven of peace, and he regarded it as his
                "masterpiece".<sup

                Even then, he was not yet done. He created his series of cutout
                art studying the female body <em>the Blue Nudes</em> and at the
                age of eighty <em>The Snail,</em> the year before he died.

                To survive in his years since his operation, Matisse completely
                reinvented his own artistic style and changed the medium of his
                art in his quest to overcome the limitations of his immobility.
                When interviewed for the documentary
                <em>Matisse. A Cut Above the Rest,</em> Hilary Spurling, writer,
                and Matisse biographer, described this drive as:
              </p>
              <p>
                "Matisse couldn't live if he couldn't work, literally. And I
                think those last years when he made the cutouts and when he was
                an invalid and bed-ridden was a complete illustration of that.
                He had to invent an art form which he could still practice and
                practice with the intensity and the passion and pour into it the
                energy and power that he had then as he always had had."

                When addressing limitations, it would be straightforward to
                highlight Lee Krasner as a female artist who was confronted
                during her entire career with the stifling limitations of sexism
                and gender discrimination. She was, after all, famous for
                quoting a critic as having said:
              </p>
              <p>
                "The first approval comes in this form: This is so good, you
                wouldn't know it was done by a woman".<sup

                Instead, this section will focus on how transformed her work and
                style because of a different kind of adversity and to overcome
                the limitations of <em>light.</em> As a formally trained
                colorist, she regarded it as an utmost necessity to paint in
                colors only when exposed to natural light. This she could not do
                when she set out to create her masterpiece
                <em>The Eye is the First Circle.</em> Therefore, she changed her
                style of painting, and the reason for this will be explained in
                detail after an introduction to Krasner.

              <p>
                Lee Krasner was born in 1908 in Brooklyn, New York. She was the
                first child to be born in the US in her family who emigrated
                from Russia. At fourteen, she decided to be an artist and stayed
                true to that vision despite it being an incredibly difficult
                climate for anybody, but particularly a woman, to become an
                artist during the great depression.
              </p>
              <p>
                In 1941, she met Jackson Pollock for the first time when they
                were exhibiting together at the McMillan Gallery. She was
                familiar with Willem de Kooning and Stuart Davis, but Pollock
                was the only artist at the show that she did not know, so she
                decided to visit his studio. Their relationship became important
                to both, and eventually they married. They shared their house in
                Springs, Long Island, until Pollock's death in 1956. Yet this
                relationship with the celebrated abstract expressionist was only
                one chapter in a much longer story of Krasner's life as an
                artist.<sup

              <p>
                One of the many touching and tender things that Krasner and
                Pollock shared was that if they were working on something that
                felt threatening to them, they would pose the question to one
                another if it was a painting. If it was, then Pollock would
                assure Krasner by urging her to keep going and not give up or
                walk away.

                The first of the Umber series of paintings, a painting that
                would later be known as
                <em>The Eye is the First Circle,</em> was on Krasner's easel in
                an unfinished state when she left for France (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-81">figure 81</a>). While in
                Paris, she received the call that Pollock had died in a car
                accident.

                She could not walk away from her painting, she had to complete
                it even in her deadening state of grief. In an interview with
                her poet friend Richard Howard, Lee Krasner described her state
                of mind at the time:

              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Let me say that when I painted a good part of these things, I
                was going down deep into something which wasn't easy or
                pleasant. In fact, I painted a great many of them because I
                couldn't sleep nights. I got tired of fighting insomnia and
                tried to paint instead. And I realized that if I was going to
                work at night, I would have to knock color out altogether,

                Krasner moved into Pollock's studio space at his farm. She was
                the executor of his estate tasked with managing his legacy, and
                the studio must have been an emotionally loaded space for her.
                But she wanted to paint, and it was the largest space available
                to her. It had bright, natural light flowing in through the
                windows. The available space allowed her to work on large format
                paintings by taking unstretched canvas four to five meters in
                length attached it to the wall. The Umber series occurs at the
                peak of this moment of her discovering the possibilities of
                scale and the possibilities of this new space.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her work on the Umber series was something she could make her
                own, following her own artistic voice. Krasner was suffering
                from extreme insomnia, so she worked at night under artificial
                light. She could not bring herself to use colors because she
                regarded it almost a criminal act to work with color without
                natural light. Working in the brown, cream, and white color
                palette retroactively named umber allowed her to continue to
                work even in these difficult circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                Like the later paintings in the Umber series,
                <em>The Eye is the First Circle</em> is made predominantly in
                raw and burnt colors in oil. Krasner cherished the organic
                properties of working in oil and the color, or rather lack
                thereof, had an organic quality. She was only around 1.63 meters
                tall and she would go "into" this large-scale painting three
                times larger than her and continually work on it until she felt
                that it reached a point of completion.

              <h4>6.4.3 Cory Arcangel and the Sublime Subversion of Glitch</h4>
              <p>
                American post-conceptual artist Cory Arcangel is a member of the
                Beige Programming Ensemble, a group that focuses their artistic
                efforts on the hacker's ethic and manipulates commercial
                technologies. They use existing technical infrastructure
                available in the consumer realm to profoundly modify perceptions
                about consumerism and media, often repurposing the technology as
                glitch art. Glitch art is the practice of corrupting and
                manipulating analog or digital devices to output errors for
                aesthetic purposes.<sup

              </p>
              <p>
                One of Arcangel's most discussed pieces is
                <em>Super Mario Clouds,</em> created in 2002. This example of
                glitch art is based on <em>Super Mario Bros.,</em> probably the
                most famous platform and "jump 'n run" game for the Nintendo
                Entertainment System (NES). The original game was published in
                1985.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cory Arcangel hacked the game and edited its code to remove all
                the game elements, leaving only the screen background with white
                clouds. The screen forever scrolls from right to left at the
                pace of the usual game progression, completely devoid of the
                main Mario character sprite, the enemy sprites, the platforms,
                obstacles, and collectible items. It ran completely silently
                without any of the well-known music or sound effects. Arcangel
                removed the complete narrative structure of the game and its
                interactivity, making it unplayable. By recontextualizing the
                game as a purely visual experience, Arcangel transformed into to
                an area onto which the audience can project their expectations
                and imagination.

                If an audience member is familiar with the original game, they
                would regard it as incomplete or limited—even broken. This is
                especially true with a younger audience familiar with the Super
                Mario game because Nintendo's media franchise permeated pop
                culture over the decades. In most cases, they could recognize
                the clouds from the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> game.

              <p>
                Even in 1985, in the early days of video games, Nintendo had a
                strict licensing policy for game customers and game publishers
                alike. Only Nintendo could produce the game cartridges for game
                developers. They had integrated a security chip as an early form
                of digital rights management (DRM).<sup

                When a game studio developed a game, they had to submit it to
                Nintendo for quality control. Quality control was not only
                limited to finding bugs in the game but was also a thorough
                check of Nintendo's strict family policy at the time. A common
                rule for action and shooting games was to reduce the gore and,
                in some cases, remove all blood from the graphics. Only when
                Nintendo gave its official seal of approval could the game
                studio order the cartridge's production from Nintendo at a high
                price and with a minimum required production run. In the
                mid-1980s, game makers had no alternative to Nintendo in the
                home console market. Nintendo had a 70% market share in Japan,
                Europe, and North America.
              </p>
              <p>
                Super Mario Bros. was Nintendo's intellectual property.
                Development was led by fabled Japanese games developer Shigeru
                Miyamoto.<sup

                The game cartridge came with a printed end user agreement in the
                package, which prohibited customers from tampering with or
                modifying the cartridge. Cory Arcangel intentionally ignored
                this limitation, even though he knew Nintendo was famously
                litigious, even in cases with minimal risk to its business
                model. He proceeded to "tamper" with the game cartridge that had
                been released 17 years prior.

                Arcangel's <em>Super Mario Cloud</em> is an example of hacking
                the software and the hardware. The original game is stored on a
                video game cartridge. Arcangel downloaded the game code from the
                cartridge's ROM read-only memory chip and patched it to remove
                all playable elements. He then burned a new EPROM (erasable
                programmable read-only memory) and placed it back into the
                cartridge. Thus, Arcangel deliberately breached Nintendo's end
                user agreement. He removed the essential "video gameness" of the
                video game — it's very interactivity.<sup

              <p>In his interview with Lori Zippy in 2005, Arcangel said:</p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Super Mario Clouds is a 1985 Nintendo cartridge for the game
                Super Mario Brothers, which I have taken apart and reprogrammed
                to show only the clouds from the game and scroll them across a
                blue sky. By putting it on my Web site I was saying, Here's what
                I made, and here's the source code and a little bit of

              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In the process of creating the piece, Arcangel broke the legal
                limitations imposed by Nintendo, and thus the commercial
                limitations of use. Yet they did not sue him. He even released
                the source code on his website and made the actual working ROM
                file available.<sup

                The piece was exhibited as an installation with the manipulated
                video game's screen projected onto a large area with a quaint
                CRT display running in parallel (see
                <a href="#circuits-ablaze-figure-83">figure 83</a>). Arcangel
                described the project as pushing representation toward
                abstraction. He removed as many elements as possible before the
                original source became completely unrecognizable, leaving the
                clouds as the only identifiable elements—the same clouds that
                were the only non-interactive elements and solely acting as
                background ornaments within the original game.

                In the 1960s, Kusama moved from the Japanese Kyoto to New York
                City and became an active participant in the world of art.

              <p>
                The dominant features of her paintings were dots: polka dots,
                colored dots on white, white dots as negative space on a colored
                background, like the stars in the heavenly canopy. Kusama said
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "With one polka dot, nothing can be achieved"

                Kusama experienced a troubled childhood and that resulted in
                mental health issues. From the age of ten, she suffered from
                hallucinations. They were the reason for her use of dots,
                flashes of light, and (oddly enough) pumpkins in her art.<sup

                The stigma of mental problems and the desire to understand her
                hallucinations even at a young age caused her to sink deep into
                her art. Her artistic expression in painting and her use of dots
                and colors were largely for therapeutic purposes. She believed
                that all things in the world are disintegrated and that
                everything is comprised of an infinite number of dots. She
                perceived herself as a dot in the larger universe and that each
                person on the earth is part of the hundreds of millions of the
                polka dots forming up the whole system.<sup

                She used paper and paint to express her visions transforming
                them into the highly unique renditions characterized by eternal

                For the better part of her early career of arts, Kusama
                struggled to achieve fame and gain recognition in the art world.
                One of the major hindering factors was her battle with mental
                health problems. She refused let these challenges impede her and
                pursued her interests despite these significant health issues.
                Kusama was faced with strategic limitations from society as she
                hailed from the conservative society in Japan. Racism, sexism,
                and social censure were equally major cultural limitations that
                Kusama had to overcome to become one of the most successful
                female artists of the 20<sup>th</sup> century.
              </p>
              <p>
                Richard Castellane, former owner of the Castellane gallery,
                described the effect of Kusama's installations:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "She was taking away your ability to focus, breaking all
                boundaries in space... and the exhibitions that I had, in
                particular the 'Peep show', that did the job. It was an
                octagonal room, it was painted black, and there were openings
                where you could stick your head in. And the ceiling of it set up
                a series of lights ... Up till Kusama there were many artists
                from the renaissance on who were involved with perspective and
                infinity. But it was all a fake, because you knew, you, the
                viewer, were always aware that you were the master... that it
                was a painting that was encompassed by a frame and the artist
                was playing with space, but it wasn't enveloping you."

                Kusama faced resistance based on her race as a Japanese in the
                post-war period and more universally just for being a woman. In
                1977, she was exhausted and returned to Japan after suffering
                severe mental health problems. She was admitted to a psychiatric
                hospital in Tokyo. Anxiety and depression were her constant
                companions, permanent effects of her mental health issues.
                However, these personal, emotional, and perceptional limitations
                did not deter her from practicing painting as an art.<sup

                On the contrary, she succeeded in using art as a form of therapy
                and a way of expressing her perception of the world around her.
                Kusama described her approach as:

              <p>Tate Modern's Frances Morris described Kusama as:</p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "To go back to Tokyo and to start from scratch again, for
                Kusama, was quite extraordinary... because she wasn't known
                there, and she hadn't been recognized. Clearly, the strains and
                stresses of life, the memories, had forced her to withdraw, but
                what she's always done, she has always managed that process
                incredibly well. Kusama is now living in a mental institution,
                but by day she occupies across the street in a busy suburban
                neighborhood of Tokyo a very well-appointed studio facility,
                where she has a team of assistants and she has a space for her
                painting, a space for her library, her archive. And every
                morning she gets there, and she is the consummate professional
                and she works from nine to six. I think there is a sort of a
                'managing madness' about Kusama, which is so utterly sane. It is
                quite interesting, she has used her trauma, she has used these
                experiences in her past, she has been able to harness the
                experiences that might drive other people insane to enormously
                productive ends. She's an extraordinary person in that way."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Kusama's life and art was rightly contrasted with artists such
                as Vincent van Gogh, who both inflicted self-harm and attempted
                suicide due to their mental health issues. Kusama found a new
                and effective way of expressing her world through art; an
                endeavor largely celebrated in the modern world of social media.
                Collections of her work attract a significant number of visitors
                in museums and exhibitions and her art has found a deep
                resonance with a modern audience.

              <p>
                The section above is not intended to be presumptuous. Rather, it
                serves to demonstrate that limitations, and the human potential
                to overcome them, are an inherent driving factor of art (and of
                other areas, too). Juxtaposing the technical limitations that
                drove The Exceptions to produce their demo art with the
                limitations surpassed by highly regarded figures from art
                history as Matisse, Krasner, Arcangel and Kusama exemplifies how
                overcoming limitations acts as a motor for other artists whose
                work has greatly impacted history.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are artists who struggled with physical impairment,
                emotional distress, legal restrictions, or mental health
                challenges forcing them to transform their art in ways that
                would not have been necessary otherwise, but in the process,
                they elevate their art, advancing unique modes of artistic
                expression to become icons in art history.
              </p>
              <p>
                Yet limitations, both perceived or actual, and the urge to
                transgress them is a fundamental motivation for artists and
                among them the demo-makers.

              <p>
                In the oral history of the Atari ST demoscene as chronicled by
                Marco Breddin in Breakin' the Borders, one of The Exceptions,
                Erik Simon, said:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "In the beginning we met in my room [to work on our demos] and I
                would fall asleep at around 3 in the morning while the other
                guys would happily continue coding. It was a great time. We did
                things that nobody had done before, which grants a very special
                quality of creative satisfaction. In hindsight, the refusal to
                accept limits without question was essential to our later
                professional - and hobbyist careers. Apart from that, the Atari
                ST scene was very friendly and stuck together. There was less
                rivalry than in other demo scenes. The logical way in which
                people from all over Europe became friends at demo parties and
                worked together on projects has strongly influenced my viewpoint
                on the important questions of life and politics."<sup

                This shows how every single piece of computer art, from the
                humblest demo, like README.PRG, to the grandest mega-demo, like
                the B.I.G. Demo and the Union Demo, is a unique piece of art.
                They may not appeal to all sensibilities or represent the
                pinnacle of the demoscene, but they are art all the same. They
                exist because they can, not because they must. They exist
                because the demo-makers chose to make them so.

              <p>
                The Exceptions exercised their imagination, creativity, and
                ingenuity to turn their ideas into a reality. Art makes its
                creators what they are. As we as humans learn to use tools, we
                strive to express ideas that transcend the limitations of what
                is possible, the limitations of our craft, and even the
                limitations of our existence. We have been compelled to create
                things that will outlast our fleeting interest, perhaps even our
                short lives.
              </p>
              <p>
                Demo-makers wanted to create images and music that enthralled
                and captivated their audience. Their art is an expression not
                only of who they are, who they were, but of who they might be;
                both the good and the bad.
              </p>
              <p>
                The early demoscene allowed the demo-makers to explore their
                highest aspirations and their deepest fear of failure. Through
                the power of compassion and kindness, they united to become a
                creative force that was more than the sum of its parts. They
                were a force to shatter the technical limits of the hardware
                they chose to create demos with motives from fantasy and science
                fiction, as well as abstract algorithmic images. Yet, in some
                rare places we can see some of their juvenile cruelty and hatred
                manifesting in their work.
              </p>
              <p>
                The stories of how demo-makers created their demos thrill us
                with their courage and determination, adventure and excitement,
                and a bit of anger. We learn how they worked on their demo art
                and how they overcome the restrictions., imparting us with
                wisdom and knowledge and stirring our wonder and imagination.
                The demo-makers working together inventing the code and the
                process when creating their demos shows us the strength of
                friendship and collaboration and still emphasizing individual
                achievements.

                The Exceptions were not driven by commercial interests or
                requirements of a sponsor. They were free to be bold and
                creative, inspiring, and challenging, and provocative, swanky
                show-offs.

                Perhaps we recognize aspects of ourselves in their undertakings,
                at least to a certain extent, as we try to convince the machines
                that we work with every day to do what we need and want them to
                do. Perhaps we look up to these nerds,<sup

                the demo-makers, because we want to take back some of the
                control from digital machines; control that demo-makers so aptly
                demonstrated belongs squarely in the hands of users.
              </p>

                As the heroic character Tron in the eponymous movie from 1982
                said so fittingly: <em>"I fight for the users".</em> Today, we
                are all users. Can we find solace in the thought that someone
                might continue fighting for us by shattering limits?
