                software-based new media art, like demos. The proposed solutions
                focus on demos but are equally applicable to other online

                A2.1 The Necessity of Conserving New Media Art in General
              </h3>
              <p>
                When we think of physical art conservation, we imagine
                conservators meticulously touching up and refurbishing the
                brushstrokes of a painting or painstakingly cleaning out decades
                and centuries of pollution from a sculpture's pores and cracks.
                We know why this arduous and time-consuming work is necessary.
                We understand that physical artworks are more than just relics
                of the past; they are our cultural heritage that shows us the
                origins of civilization's currents and flows, what cultures
                believed in, where they might have made mistakes, and which
                ideas sprung forth from them. We understand that physical art
                needs to be examined, preserved, researched, and documented so
                that we not only see it through the eyes of the present but can
                grasp what it represents in its original context.
              </p>
              <p>
                As difficult as it is to conserve physical artifacts, they have
                been brought into existence, and even though they succumb to
                decay and corrosion, they are observable and can be beheld
                without any further doing by following generations. This is not
                true of most new media art, particularly of software-based art
                such as demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Software-based art needs to be made to run so that it can be
                beheld. It was created on the technology of the past. Some
                software can only run on obsolete technology and needs to be
                adapted to more current technology. The technology used for
                other software is undocumented and forgotten, making it very
                difficult or even impossible to run the art anymore.
              </p>
              <p>
                As software-based art, demos are potential victims of the same
                risks of being lost. They were programmed to run as close to the
                actual hardware as possible, often written in assembly language
                that is specific to a processor architecture. They mostly take
                advantage of a computer's undocumented capabilities and
                features. In some cases, these features were specific to a
                specific model of machine. Without documentation, demos can be
                lost in the sands of time. It is not enough to simply salvage a
                demo's files and then launch them whenever needed. Information
                about the exact system configuration is necessary to make them
                run at all and as authentically as possible.

              </h3>
              <p>
                The Department for Image Science at Danube University Krems has
                researched the challenges facing digital art preservation and
                has fought for best practices in its conservation. For more than
                two decades, the Archive of Digital Art (ADA) has pioneered the
                collection and documentation of digital artwork at

                ADA is managed and operated at the Danube University Krems under
                the leadership of Univ.-Prof. Dr. Oliver Grau, based on the
                fundamentals first established in his publication "Virtual Art:

                archive will connect the object or document with other archives,
                artefacts, information, people, and events. The archive will
                progressively absorb duties and features from other institutions
                and cultural entities, such as databases, installations, games,
                networks, knowledge tools, etc."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                In <em>MediaArtHistories,</em> Grau describes the objective of
                any digital art archive:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "Over the last thirty years media art has evolved into a vital
                factor of the contemporary artistic scene. Digital art has
                become the art of our times, yet it has not 'arrived' in the
                cultural institutions of our societies. It is still rarely
                collected, it is not included or supported under the auspices of
                art history or other academic disciplines, and it is almost
                inaccessible for the non-north-Western public and their
                scholars. To change this is our goal!"
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                Therefore, the main purpose of the concrete archival efforts in
                the demoscene can be distilled down to the following objectives:
              </p>

              <h4>A2.3.1. Description of the Demo Artifact</h4>
              <p>
                The scholarly description should provide details of the demo
                artifact itself. This includes descriptions of the depicted
                imagery, music and text content, the system it was designed for,
                and the historical context of its release (e.g., at a demo
                party, in a public domain library, in a BBS, or as part of a
                diskzine, etc.). Ideally, the context and process of its
                creation should be provided.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the description should include which limitations
                the demo exceeded in the hardware it was created on or that were
                imposed at the outset of its creation (e.g., arbitrary RAM
                limits, time limits during a demo party, etc.). Where available,
                the description should include information on the technologies
                used, including the hardware, graphics software, music
                composition applications, programming language, etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                Just as applicable to the scholarly analysis of demo art, Oliver
                Grau argues for an overarching strategy in the art-historic
                critique and analysis of <em>all</em> media art:

              <p>
                The demo archive cannot be the be-all, end-all of an artifact's
                information. It must show the relationships between the
                described pieces and their creators and events, such as
                exhibitions or demo parties. This information does not have to
                be in the actual demo archive but can reference other archives
                or sources outside of the demo archive. In most cases, the
                demo's actual assets, such as the source code, will be in a code
                repository like GitHub or Gitlab. Assets, artists, and events
                should be linked to the artifacts and put into the right context
                to understand their relationships.
              </p>

              <h4>A2.3.3. Digital Assets of the Demo</h4>
              <p>
                Since demos are software-based new media art, they can be
                reduced to two sets of assets:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The source code, graphical assets (sprites and image tiles),
                  and music files (chip music compositions, music modules, and
                  sound samples).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The executable file that run on the original hardware. These
                  are the compiled/assembled programs.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Ideally, the digital assets would provide direct links to a code
                repository of the source code, such as on GitHub or GitLab, as
                well as links to the packaged executables, either on disk images
                or as program files.
              </p>
              <p>
                The assets can also include descriptive files, like screenshots
                of the demo running on original hardware and full video
                recordings of the demo, such as on YouTube).
              </p>

              <h4>
                A2.3.4 Documentation and Instructions for Conservation Purposes
              </h4>
              <p>
                Finally, a good demo archive should include documentation on the
                preservation and conservation of the demo art. This can include
                instructions on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  How to run the demo on historic hardware and which
                  configurations it will run on.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How to run the demo on historic hardware that has been updated
                  with contemporary hardware, e.g., with a USB replacement for
                  the disk drive and with a scan doubler for output on LCDs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  How to run the demo using an emulator on a modern PC
                  (including the exact configuration and ROMs) or on an FPGA
                  implementation of the retro hardware.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If possible, instructions on how to recreate the demos using
                  contemporary technologies, like HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Furthermore, the documentation can include the ideal way of
                running and experiencing the demo, e.g., on a CRT display as
                opposed to a more modern LCD. If there are no assets preserved,
                then instructions on how to preserve the demo files (i.e., pull
                them from the physical media like floppy disks and store them in
                an archival format) can be provided.

                A2.4 Achieving Critical Mass Through a Collaborative Effort
              </h3>
              <p>
                There have been thousands, perhaps even tens of thousands, of
                demos created over the decades. Therefore, it would take a great
                effort to describe, document, and preserve all of them. No
                single organization will be able to cover all the demos ever
                created, and no single organization has to. There is a
                passionate and vocal community around the demoscene, and many of
                the original creators are still alive and active. The best way
                to approach a comprehensive effort to archive and document demos
                is to tap into the community's dedication and passion and
                provide a platform for a focused collaborative effort.
                Authorship of individual articles on demo artifacts, demo
                parties, and the demo creators should be shared.
              </p>
              <p>
                One editor might create the skeleton of an article, perhaps only
                including the demo's name and the system it ran on. Another user
                can then elaborate on that and add a more detailed description.
                Yet another user can add screenshots or other assets to the
                article. If one user makes a mistake or adds erroneous
                information, other users can and will make the necessary
                corrections. Over time, an established archive has the potential
                to cover ever larger parts of the demoscene.

              <h3 class="mt-5">A2.5 A New Demo Archive?</h3>
              <p>
                Why would it be necessary to create a new archive of demos?
                There are the two major cross-platform demo archives, pouet.net
                and demozoo.org, that store demo files and some information
                about the release, such as the name of the demo group and the
                release date. In particular, pouet.net is extremely
                comprehensive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unfortunately, neither of these two archives actually document
                the demos. They do not describe the demo's content, do not
                analyze, and, most of all, do not document the techniques used
                to create the demo and describe the necessary original hardware
                to run it authentically, and the method to run it in emulation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Demoscene enthusiasts might find it obvious at present and do
                not need any further documentation, but this is not sustainable
                in the future. Even enthusiasts have trouble finding the right
                combination of factors. Providing the right documentation can
                ensure that decades-old demo art can still be experienced.
              </p>
              <p>
                Furthermore, a potential new archive can include art historians
                and technical archeologists' perspectives on the pieces. They
                can include interpretations, examinations, and in-depth
                research.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em>Pouet.net</em> and <em>demozoo.org</em> are excellent
                repositories for demo art, but they are not enough. An archive
                is needed not only for the files and some meta information, but
                also for research and documentation on the demo materials'
                conservation.
              </p>
              <p>What would a "future-proof" demo archive look like?</p>

                A2.6 Technical Solutions for Implementing a Demo Archive
              </h3>
              <p>
                In this section, technical solutions will be presented to map
                out the requirements for an archive of demo art and media, a
                digital archive dedicated to the preservation and documentation
                of demo art. It should be conceived as a free digital art
                database that showcases, analyzes, and preserves demo art from
                the 1980s to the present day, serving as a rich trove of
                historical and contemporary demo art that is open for all to
                share, interact with, and explore.
              </p>
              <p>
                As previously established, it is not enough to simply salvage
                and archive demo files. The archive's technical infrastructure
                must provide for this in any case. Yet, a truly sustainable
                archive provides space to present demo research, analysis, and
                interpretation, and the information on configuring the obsolete
                hardware or emulators that are needed to run them. Details on
                the hardware and software setup are vital to run a demo as
                authentically as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Above all, this archive should be designed to be open and
                accessible for anyone in the community to join. Like Wikipedia,
                the archive should allow users to edit articles as well as
                create them. By focusing on collaboration in the passionate and
                vocal demoscene subculture, the archive can tap into the vast
                reservoirs of knowledge that this community holds. An open model
                of collaboration allows for swifter documentation and analysis.
              </p>

              <h4>A2.6.1 Features of a Potential Archive of Demo Art</h4>
              <p>
                The most central feature of an archive should be the ability to
                search for demo artwork. Once users have found what they are
                looking for, they can select the piece they are interested in
                and learn more on a dedicated page for each item that details
                information through descriptions, characteristic tables, images,
                and videos. The archive should provide cross references to
                information about the artist and the history of the demo's
                creation, with information about exhibitions where the digital
                art was displayed or the demo party where it was created. The
                archive should provide the executable files, source code, and
                disk images needed to run the demo if available.
              </p>
              <p>
                The objective should be to create a sophisticated database that
                represents a centralized source and repository of demo art.
              </p>

              <h4>
                A2.6.2 Options for an Open and Collaborative Archive of Demo Art
              </h4>
              <p>
                There are several different technical approaches to establishing
                an online archive. The most important factor is the
                collaborative aspect; users should be able to register as
                editors and input information about demos and other related
                topics. This collaborative process can either go through a
                review before publication or be published immediately to undergo
                scrutiny by users, who will then edit and polish the article.
              </p>
              <p>
                This section discusses possible technical implementations. There
                are three major directions that can be taken:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Open-Source Solutions:</strong> Either through the use
                  of already-established web software currently in operation,
                  e.g., Wikipedia, or by using the underlying technology, the
                  <em>Wiki,</em> a collaborative environment on the web,
                  specifically the open-source project called
                  <em>MediaWiki.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Proprietary Solution:</strong> General archiving
                  solutions are nearly as old as the computer industry, so there
                  are a number of commercially available, proprietary products
                  for art archives. This section will briefly discuss
                  <em>Artwork Archive</em> as an example.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Custom Implementation:</strong> Considering how
                  advanced current web technologies are and how easy it is to
                  use their available components; it is perfectly feasible to
                  build an archive as a bespoke implementation to cover all the
                  required features. The final part of this section describes a
                  case study for implementing a tailor-made online demo archive
                  solution using Angular, NodeJS, and Heroku.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h4>A2.6.3 Approach I: Open-Source Solutions</h4>
              <p>
                A Wiki is quite familiar to a general audience as Wikipedia, its
                most well-established implementation. This type of hypertext
                publication is edited and managed collaboratively by a community
                of registered users.
              </p>
              <p>
                <em
                  >Why not simply use Wikipedia to archive demo art or any kind
                  of digital art?</em
                >
                The online encyclopedia is well-established and well-known. It
                is a knowledge source referenced by millions of users across the
                globe. There are hundreds of thousands of users already
                contributing or helping others contribute, writing new articles,
                and correcting existing articles on Wikipedia.
              </p>
              <p>
                Using Wikipedia is the easiest solution. It is as simple as
                creating the necessary users who can then start adding in-depth
                descriptions of the demos.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before moving forward with this solution, two issues need to be
                considered.
              </p>

              <h5>
                A2.6.3.1 Wikipedia's Notability Policy and Other Guidelines
              </h5>
              <p>
                Wikipedia targets a wide audience; therefore, it has a
                notability policy stating:
              </p>
              <blockquote class="alert alert-secondary">
                "On Wikipedia, notability is a test used by editors to decide
                whether a given topic warrants its own article."<sup
                  ><a
                    id="circuits-ablaze-appendix-2-origin-a2-102"
                    href="#circuits-ablaze-appendix-2-footnote-a2-102"
                    >[102]</a
                  ></sup
                >
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                The highly specialized nature of individual pieces of demo art
                (and other digital art) might contradict this notability policy
                because separately describing each individual piece might be too
                obscure to be notable. Of course, it would have to be tested to
                see if this would really happen. But in any case, using
                Wikipedia as a platform as a digital art archive requires
                accepting this entity's policies.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the long run, this can be counterproductive to submit to
                someone else's rules because the policies can change and
                conflict with the archival efforts.
              </p>

              <h5>
                A2.6.3.2 Institutional Credit and Delivery on Funded Project
                Objectives
              </h5>
              <p>
                Writing and correcting the large number of demo art articles
                required to cover the whole field is a daunting task. Solely
                relying on volunteers and enthusiasts will yield very
                heterogeneous results. An archive requires a degree of
                standardization in its articles, a clear overall taxonomy, and a
                normalization of its data sets.
              </p>
              <p>
                This can only be achieved by a concerted effort between
                academics and experts working on the archive for years, which
                would require funding. Any grants for funds define objectives
                and metrics that need to be met so that a project can be deemed
                a success. With its "free for all to edit" approach, Wikipedia
                makes it difficult, or even impossible, to enforce
                standardization according to outside principles. Therefore, a
                more institutionalized and curated approach is necessary while
                still employing the strengths of the Wiki principle but under
                the archive's management control.

                A curated and institutionalized archive can be operated with
                open-source software. MediaWiki is probably the most widely
                adopted open-source implementation, and is available free of
                charge at

                MediaWiki is an elaborate content management system (CMS) with a
                focus on articles. Users can quickly access well-structured and
                networked article collections. Its key functionality is the
                ability to supplement and improve articles just as easily as
                reading them. MediaWiki enables users to edit content themselves
                and communicate with one another, and it logs all changes made
                to articles such that users can compare and contrast previous
                texts and even restore old versions if necessary.

              <p>
                One of these proprietary solutions is called Artwork Archive. It
                is a cloud-based database specifically for the archiving of art.
                It offers a subscription-based pricing model and is a managed

                ADAM is a practical implementation, but it also lays the
                conceptual groundwork for the user interface of a demo archive.
                It was inspired by the Archive of Digital Art (ADA) at Danube
                University Krems. ADAM only contains placeholder content at the
                time of this writing, showcasing its user interface, the
                powerful search and filter features, and its user management.

                Figure 102: The architecture of ADAM
              </p>

              <p>
                This three-tiered structure might look fragmented with too many
                component parts, but it in fact has many advantages. By
                separating the different functions, ADAM can offer not only the
                web-frontend for users visiting with a web browser, but at a
                later time, also offer a mobile app. This is made possible by
                the separate application programming interface (API). The API
                also allows for ADAM to connect with other art archives and
                provides its data for a federated search.
              </p>
              <p>
                And the final advantage is that when a new and better technology
                becomes available, any part of ADAM can be replaced individually
                without interfering with the operations of the others.

                commands:
              </p>
              <div class="mx-5">

              <p>
                The web frontend can be launched locally on port 4200 by
                entering:

                Please note: If you want to use the locally running API server
                for the web frontend, you will find the URL of the API in the
                file <em>src/app/apirequestservice.service.ts</em>. Simply
                change this to <em>http://localhost:5003,</em> then everything
                will only run locally. You can run the frontend on
                <em>http://localhost:4200</em> and refer all data from the API
                to
                <em>http://localhost:5003</em>

              <h4>A2.6.6 Conclusion of the Case Study</h4>
              <p>
                This case study of ADAM, the Archive of Demo Art & Media, shows
                how much is possible by using web technologies that were
                developed by large communities. ADAM is built on these
                established web technologies, hosted on a managed cloud
                platform, and leverages MongoDB for its data. ADAM ensures a
                strict separation between the user interface, the API, and the
                data.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is not a revolutionary solution, but rather a proven,
                modern approach that matches the requirements and needs of an
                archive of digital art. It is expandable and "future-proof."
                Over the next few years, whenever a certain web technology
                becomes inevitably deprecated or a far better option arises,
                that component can be swapped out or migrated to a new
                technology. When Angular has served its time as the frontend
                framework used for ADAM, a new framework with the next
                generation of features can be implemented without interfering
                with the API and database. If the API's cloud service is no
                longer a viable option, the existing NodeJS code can be easily
                moved to a different cloud service. Should MongoDB's great
                performance and advanced features due to the document-based data
                model be eclipsed by an even more advanced database solution,
                then the data can be migrated to this database without requiring
                changes to the web frontend and with only minor adaptations to
                the API.
              </p>
              <p>
                By approaching the custom archive solution as component-based
                building blocks, the archive remains flexible and open to future
                developments.
              </p>

              <h5>A2.7 The Right Solution for the Right Archive</h5>
              <p>
                In the discussion above, it has been established that using
                Wikipedia is too broad of a solution that has the risk of
                submitting to another party's rules and policies. Likewise, a
                proprietary solution will prove to be expensive, inflexible, and
                carries the risk of vendor lock-in.
              </p>
              <p>
                The two most viable options to set up an archive of demo art
                are:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>The use of a MediaWiki:</strong> Of the two options,
                  this is the fastest, cheapest, and easiest option while
                  maintaining some level of control. Future development is
                  handled by the MediaWiki community, including security patches
                  and the adoption of next-generation technologies. The major
                  risk is that the product was developed to meet a very wide
                  range of needs, most not applicable to an art archive's
                  specific requirements. This does not necessarily have to be a
                  disadvantage, but it does risk having to wait for the
                  MediaWiki community to develop a future feature specific to
                  the art archive.
                </li>

                    Media:</strong
                  >
                  If the necessary financing is secured, then it is relatively
                  reasonable and affordable to develop an archive solution based
                  on community-created web technologies. This offsets the need
                  to develop everything from scratch while still allowing
                  targeting of the exact requirements. This bespoke approach is
                  more expensive, but the results are exactly what is needed for
                  an art archive.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Regardless of the approach taken, an archive should be open and
                accessible to a large audience and potential contributors. It
                should allow for federated data sources in other archives. Only
                by being open can a demo archive be a gift for today's
                demoscene. Not only that, it can also be a gift for tomorrow's
                media art historians, artists, and technologists seeking to
                learn how yesterday's artists were able to create demo art
                despite the constraints and limitations of the technology used.
